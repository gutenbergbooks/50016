<h2>A DARK EVENING.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-h.jpg" width="56" height="98" alt="H" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">HE was just discouraged, and that was
the whole of it. He sat close to the
stove, leaned his ragged elbow on his
knee, and his cheek on a rather sooty
hand, and gave himself up to troubled
thought, the two books which had slipped from
him, lying unheeded on the floor.</p>

<p>Let them lie there; what was the use in trying
to study? Here was the third evening this
week that he had been held, after hours, when
he wanted to go to the night school and find
out how to do that example! He might just as
well give up first as last.</p>

<p>There was a loud stamping outside, and the
door of the little flag station burst open, letting
in a rush of spiteful winter air.</p>

<p>“Halloo!” said a boy of about fourteen, muffled
to his eyes in fur.</p>

<p>“Halloo yourself,” said the boy by the stove,
without changing his position more than was
necessary to glance up.</p>

<p>“Has the six o’clock freight gone down yet?”</p>

<p>“Not as I know of; I wish she would be
about it; I’ve been waiting on her now an hour
after time.”</p>

<p>“Lucky for me she is behind, though; I guess
I can catch a ride into town on her, can’t I?
I’ve been out to Windmere, and missed the five
o’clock mail; I set out to foot it, but it is
rather rough walking against this wind; especially
when you have to walk on ice. I’d rather
be toted in on the freight, than to try it. Do
you suppose they will give me a lift?”</p>

<p>“You can sit down and wait, and try for it,
if you like,” and the boy glanced toward a
three-legged stool.</p>

<p>“I’d give you this chair only it hasn’t any
bottom,” he said, with a dreary attempt at a
smile.</p>

<p>“The stool is all right. Do you have to wait
every night for the freight?”</p>

<p>“No; not much oftener than every other
night; it isn’t my business to wait at all, but as
often as three times a week the fellow in charge
wants me to do that, or something else, after
I’m off duty.”</p>

<p>“So you fill up the time with reading; that’s
a good idea. What have you here?”</p>

<p>The visitor stooped and picked up the fallen
books.</p>

<p>“Arithmetic and History! You are studying,
eh? Well, now, I call that industrious.
Where do you go to school?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere. I pretend to go to the evening
class at the Twenty-third Street Station, and
sometimes I get there twice in the week, and
sometimes only once. It’s a discouraging kind
of studying. I’ve been after one example for
two weeks and can’t get it.”</p>

<p>“Whereabouts are you? Ho! that old fellow;
I remember him. I can show you about
it, there’s just a mean little catch to it; but
you’ve done well to get so far along.”</p>

<p>Then the two heads bent over the book, and
over the row of figures on the margin of a
freight bill; and presently the face of the discouraged
boy lighted with a smile; he saw
through the “catch.” Then there was a little
talk between the two.</p>

<p>Ralph Westwood learned that the boy was
an orphan; was working at the freight depot
beyond his strength and on very small pay,
because times were hard, and boys plenty; that
he had a little sister in the Orphans’ Home,
and the ambition of his life was to learn, and
become a scholar, and earn money to support
the little sister. He went to school regularly
while mother lived, and worked between
times to help support himself; and mother
wanted him to be a scholar, and thought it was
in him, but she had been dead for two years,
and things were growing worse with him, and
sometimes he was discouraged.</p>

<p>Then the freight came, and Ralph Westwood
caught his ride into town, and had only time to
say:—</p>

<p>“Don’t give it up, Charlie; who knows what
may happen? Christmas is coming.”</p>

<p>“Christmas!” said Charlie to himself with a
bitter smile; what could that bring to him but
more work, because of an extra train, and late
hours and scanty fare, and not even time to run
up to the “Home” and see little Nell? Didn’t
he remember how it was last Christmas?</p>

<p>As for Ralph Westwood he waited only to
brush the snow from his clothes, and wash
away the stains of soot from his hands, which
must have been left when he shook hands with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Charlie, then he sought a handsome library
where a gentleman sat reading. Here he did
not even wait to reply to the cordial “Good
evening!” which greeted him, save as his polite
bow was a reply, then he dashed into business.
“Uncle Ralph! I have found your boy for
you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! that is quick work! Where did
you find him?”</p>

<p>“I blundered on him; the very one. I didn’t
know why I should have missed the five o’clock
train, and he didn’t know why he should have
to do overwork to-night. I hope we shall both
have a glorious reason why it worked out before
our eyes.”</p>

<p>Then he drew a low chair in front of the
lovely grate fire, and told his story.</p>

<p>That was three weeks before Christmas. A
great deal can be done in three weeks. Ralph
Westwood and his Uncle Ralph did a great
deal, and, at the end of the time, knew almost
more about Charlie Watson than he knew of
himself.</p>

<p>The end of it all, or, more properly speaking,
the beginning of it all, came to Charlie on
Christmas eve: an invitation to Dr. Westwood’s
elegant home, to meet seven boys, all of
whom were in the Sabbath-school class which
Charlie had just joined.</p>

<p>I wish I had time to tell you about the dinner-table
to which they all sat down. Roast
turkey, of course, and cranberry sauce, and
chicken-pie, and jellies and tarts, and all the
elegancies of an elegant dinner, the like of which
none of them had ever seen before. At each
plate was a bouquet of roses. Think of roses
at Christmas, for eight hard-working, homeless
boys!</p>

<p>Some people might think they didn’t like
those roses with all their hearts; but some
people don’t understand some boys. Slipped
into each bouquet was a slip of paper which
said on it “Merry Christmas!” in beautiful writing,
and then followed wonderful things. One
paper was a receipt for a year’s house rent, for
one of the boys who lived with his mother, and
had hard work to meet the landlord’s agent each
month. Another had an order on a certain
tailor for a full suit of clothes, such as it could
be plainly seen he very much needed: every
one had something. When Charlie Watson
read his, he turned red and pale by turns, and
stammered and trembled, and knew not what
to say.</p>

<p>It was longer than the others, and it took him
some time to understand it all; but at last he
made out that he was to enter the Fort Street
Grammar School as a pupil, on the Tuesday
after New Year’s, and that his home was to be
at Dr. Westwood’s office, which he was expected
to keep in order, in return for his board
and clothes.</p>

<p>What an amazing chance had come to him!
Do you wonder that he trembled and stammered?</p>

<p>But, after all, I don’t know that he was any
happier than Ralph Westwood, who hovered
about him in great satisfaction, and in one of
the pauses of his duties as assistant host, found
a chance to murmur, “I say, Charlie, aren’t
you rather glad the six o’clock freight was late,
that night?”</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Girls:</span><br />
</div>

<p>I took that first verse for mine: not because
it was short, but because the talk we had in
Sunday-school kept me thinking about it. We
were planning the next Sunday’s lesson, and one
of the girls said she didn’t see how Bible verses
could be called seeds: that set Mrs. Wheeler off
into an explanation; she told some lovely stories
about how Bible words dropped into human
hearts had borne flowers and fruit; then she suggested
that we girls try it, and see what fruit
we could raise for Christmas.</p>

<p>As you may imagine, I liked the plan ever so
much, for it made me think of you all; and I
decided to take just that verse and see how many
seeds I could sow. I had a half-dozen plans
which, if I had carried them out, would have
been splendid fruit, I am sure; and would have
made a lovely letter to write you, but they were
all spoiled, and all I can do is to tell you about
it.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday was a lovely winter day, just
the one for beginning some of my beautiful
plans, and I had been wishing I could get Aunt
Helen to go down town with me to help me do
some shopping. I thought of asking her, but
she is a rather new auntie, you know, and I
didn’t quite like to.</p>

<p>Just after dinner mamma asked me if I didn’t
want to take a basket of tea rolls to Grandma
Dunlap. She isn’t my grandma, but a very nice
old lady whom everybody calls grandma; she is
quite poor and people send her things very often.
I like to go there; the little house is so cunning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and everything as neat as wax, and old-fashioned.</p>

<p>I asked mamma if I must hurry back, and she
said, “Just as you please; if you want to take
a walk in this crisp air, there is nothing to hinder
you from being gone for a couple of hours.”</p>

<p>Then up spoke Aunt Helen, “But if you
<i>should</i> happen to come back in time to go out
shopping with me, I have some Christmas errands
which I think you might like to help
about.”</p>

<p>Just think how glad I was! I said, “O Aunt
Helen! that is just exactly what I want; and
could you find time to give me a little Christmas
advice?”</p>

<p>She laughed and said she was good for any
amount of advice.</p>

<p>I put on one of my very prettiest dresses and
my best hat, so as to be ready to go with Aunt
Helen; and then I started for Grandma Dunlap’s
as fast as I could; I said it would not take
me over a half-hour to go there and back.</p>

<p>O girls, I had such lovely schemes. I wish
I had time to tell you about them, but of what
use would it be to tell now that they are fallen
through? I had a five dollar gold piece of my
very own, and I was going to lay it out for
Christmas in what I hoped would be seeds, bearing
fruit for Jesus. And don’t you think I
didn’t do it at all! I found Grandma Dunlap
in bed; she had a hoarse cold and a headache,
and so much rheumatism that she could not even
turn over in bed.</p>

<p>“I managed to keep up until after breakfast,”
she said, “and then I went right back to bed,
and this stiffness came on me, so that I haven’t
been able to stir since.”</p>

<p>The cunning little kitchen hadn’t been swept
that day; and there wasn’t any fire on the hearth.
Grandma said it happened that nobody had been
in to see her. Now of course you know, girls,
what came to me right away; that I ought to
sweep the room and make a fire and get her
a cup of tea and something to eat. But I am
ashamed to tell you that I said to myself: “Well,
I can’t do it; Aunt Helen will be waiting for
me, and besides I have my best dress on, and
mamma does not like me to do housework in
this dress. And besides all that, if I don’t buy
some of those things <i>right away</i>, it will be too
late to carry out my plans.” I told Grandma
Dunlap I was sorry she was sick, and I would
tell mamma, and have something done for her,
and then I took my sun umbrella and turned
toward the door; when up came that verse which
I was working by, “The seed is the word,” and
along with it came the verse, “Even Christ
pleased not himself.” And another, “If Christ,
so loved us, we ought also to love one another.”
And then, piling on top of that, came the Golden
Rule about doing to others as you would have
them do to you; and, O dear! I don’t know how
many more there were; seeds, you know, which
had been dropped in my heart, and were trying
as hard as they could to spring up and bear
fruit and I was trying to choke them. I stopped
short, with my hand on the door latch and turned
around, and the queer little tile over grandma’s
chimney which has painted on it in funny old-fashioned
letters, “Polly, put the kettle on,”
seemed to speak to me as plainly as though my
name had been Polly, instead of Emmeline.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 564px;">
<img src="images/illus014.jpg" width="564" height="403" alt="Wooden sign that says: Polly put the Kettle on above picture of girl with large fireplace behind her looking out of window" />
<div class="caption">EMMELINE IS CONVINCED.</div>
</div>

<p>Grandma’s grandson painted the letters there;
he was going to be an artist if he had lived; but
he didn’t: and she hasn’t any relations in the
world. At last I said, “Wouldn’t you like a
cup of tea, Grandma?” How I did hope she
would say she couldn’t think of drinking a drop
of tea, nor eating a mouthful, and that all she
wanted was to be left alone. But she didn’t;
she smiled on me and said: “I do feel pretty
faint, Emmie, and if you could give me a bite of
your mother’s tea roll I’ll try to eat it, but I
haven’t any tea in the house.”</p>

<p>Well, of course there wasn’t any use in standing
there and trying to make believe that because
I had on my best dress I ought not to work; I
knew well enough that mamma would rather
have the dress spoiled than to have Grandma
Dunlap suffer, so I just told her that I would
go out to the corner grocery and get a little tea
and come back and make her a cup right away.
I didn’t know people ever bought less than a
pound of tea at a time, so I got a whole pound,
and it cost a whole dollar. Did you know, girls,
that good tea was so expensive? I never was so
astonished in my life. Then I found out that
there wasn’t any butter nor sugar; and I knew
mamma cooked a fresh egg for people when they
couldn’t eat much; and I bought a dozen at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
grocery that the man said had just come from
the country, and they were forty-five cents a
dozen; it must cost a great deal of money to
keep house; I had no idea what an expensive
thing it was. Just the few things which I <i>had</i>
to get for Grandma Dunlap, cost two dollars and
sixty-seven cents! Butter, it seems, is very expensive
stuff, too. The grocer sent the things
right away, and I hurried back, and turned up
the skirt of my dress, and put on a great gingham
apron of Grandma’s and made the fire, and
filled the little tea-kettle, and while it was making
up its mind to boil, I swept and dusted the
room; then I made Grandma just a lovely piece
of toast, for mamma had sent a loaf of bread, as
well as the tea rolls, and cooked her an egg, and
made her a beautiful cup of tea; then I fed her,
and she said she believed she never had had anything
so good in her life before. Then I had to
wash up the dishes, and put everything in order,
and fix Grandma’s bed, and bring in some wood,
and go over to Mrs. Barker’s to ask if Jane,
when she came from the factory, would mind
coming over and spending the night, and by the
time I had reached home, Aunt Helen had been,
and got back; just as I knew she would be; and
mamma said: “Why, child, what in the world
kept you so? I was beginning to be frightened.”
They laughed at me a little, when I told my
story, for buying a whole pound of tea, and two
pounds of butter; but mamma said I did right,
of course, not to think about my dress when there
was work which ought to be done: and she sent
word to papa to have our doctor go around and
see Grandma, and said as soon as she could leave
Baby in the morning, she would go herself.</p>

<p>And, girls, that’s the whole of the story; I
have none of the beautiful things to tell, because
I spent more than half my money, and I can’t
do them now; and besides, Aunt Helen doesn’t
go away down town shopping very often.</p>

<p>So my plans are all upset, but some way I
don’t feel so very badly about it; though I would
have liked ever so much to try how those seeds
I had in mind, would grow; maybe I can try
some of them some other time.</p>

<p>There is just a little bit more: at first I
thought I wouldn’t tell you, but I believe I will.
Grandma Dunlap said a very strange and sweet
thing to me just as I was going away. She
asked me to bend down so she could kiss me,
and then she said, “You have given the Lord
Jesus a beautiful supper to-night, Emmie.”</p>

<p>At first I was frightened; I thought she did
not know what she was saying, but she looked
at me with smiling eyes, and said: “You don’t
know what I mean? Didn’t you know there
was a lovely ‘inasmuch’ in his Book for you?
Find it when you go home, Emmie.”</p>

<p>I found what I think she meant. Do you girls
know the verse? “Inasmuch as ye did it unto
one of the least of these, my brethren, ye did it
unto me.” Not that Grandma Dunlap is one of
the “least,” she is a dear, sweet old lady that
anybody might be glad to help, but I am sure
that was what she meant; and it made me not
care very much about the rest. This isn’t much
of a story; it is only to explain to you why I
have no story to tell.</p>

<p>If I ever should do any of the nice things I
planned, I’ll tell you about them. Until then,
you must “take the will for the deed.”</p>

<h2>UP GARRET.<br />

<small>(<i>More about A Sevenfold Trouble.</i>)</small></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. C. M. Livingston.</span></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THERE is no denying that it was very hard
for Margaret Moore to give up spending
the winter with Aunt Cornelia, and,
instead, stay at home and wait on her
step-mother through a tedious illness.
When once she had made up her mind to it,
she thought the battle of life was ended and
all would hereafter go smoothly with her. Surely
she could meet and conquer anything after that.
And who can tell what she might not have done
if she had kept close to Jesus? but young disciples—and
old ones, too—wander from him
and forget that it is he they are to trust, and
not their own good resolutions.</p>

<p>Margaret forgot this, and so fell into many
snares. In the first place, she began to feel she
was very good. Instead of thinking about
Jesus, what a wonderful Saviour he was, she
thought about herself and wondered if everybody
did not think she was a self-denying, noble
girl to bear disappointments and perform disagreeable
duties so patiently. She felt very
strong and was sure she should never be cross
or angry again. And indeed for a time everything
went well. She was patient when waiting
on her step-mother and kind to her brothers.
Even Johnnie had not power to put her into a
rage, although he put burs in her hair and untied
her apron strings. There was one thing Margaret
chafed under, and that was having Amelia
Barrows, her step-mother’s sister, come to keep
house for them. Her good resolutions in no wise
extended to that person. She had made her
mind up very hard that she should not call
her “Aunt Amelia.” “She was not her aunt,
and never could be,” and “she should not be
under orders to her;” not that she would not
treat her well, but she should be dignified and
give her to understand that she was not such a
very little girl. “Thirteen and a half was nearly
fourteen—almost a young lady, she was.”</p>

<p>Amelia Barrows was a young woman with
eyes and brows as black as Margaret’s own, and a
will quite as positive. So it was to be expected
that there would be some jarring.</p>

<p>The hardest part of it all to Margaret was
that she was obliged to share her room with
Amelia. It was a large old house, but there were
not a great number of chambers, because they
were all large except the hall bedroom. When
the minister came Mrs. Moore gave that to him
for his library. So there really was no other
place for Amelia. Margaret knew it could not
be helped, and yet it was so hard to feel that
her room was not her very own private room
any more. She prided herself greatly on it, and
she really did deserve great credit for its cheerful
prettiness.</p>

<p>It was only a plain, square room with white-washed
walls and a straw matting on the floor,
but there were two pleasant windows with cheap
white muslin curtains, and the bed was daintily
dressed in white and blue. The rocker was
covered with blue cretonne, and there were blue
mats on the bureau. A bright home-made rug
on the floor, small pictures on the walls, and a
set of shelves in the corner filled with books;
then, in winter, there was always a pleasant
sense of warmth because the stovepipe came
through from the sitting-room. Altogether, it
was quite a cosey place and Margaret was always
glad to flee to it and shut herself in from all
annoyances. She thought it the prettiest, pleasantest
room in the world, and one reason was
because it was always in order. Carefulness,
when once learned, becomes a habit, and is
easier than carelessness. Young as Margaret
was when her mother died, she had been taught
by her to sweep and dust her own little room,
and to hang her clothes at night on hooks placed
within her reach, and always to put a thing in
its place after using it. She had, besides, inherited
dainty tastes and neat ways from her
mother, so it was not such a task for her to be
orderly as it was for some others.</p>

<p>And so it was with a pang that she saw
Amelia walk into her room and take possession
with the air of one who had a right there.</p>

<p>It is not easy work to wait upon a sick person,
so you must not suppose that Margaret had
nothing to do but sit within call in her step-mother’s
room handing her something occasionally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
She had to take the place of a nurse,
young as she was, in the best way she could, for
Amelia had her hands full with the housekeeping.
It was hard work, and Margaret was
often very tired. There was the room to be
put in order every morning, and Mrs. Moore
was a very particular housekeeper; not a speck
of dust, or spot on window or mirror, escaped
her keen glance. There was much running up
and down-stairs, too, for hot water and cold
water; there was liniment and mustard and
draughts to be applied by turns to the aching
limbs, and sometimes nothing helped; the pain
grew worse instead of better, and the patient
was not patient, but let fall sharp words at Margaret’s
blunders, whereupon poor Margaret
blundered still more, and did not give soft
answers. Some days, though, everything went
well, and her step-mother felt that Margaret really
was very different from what she used to be.
She was gentle and patient and tried hard to
please. The reason was plain; those were the
days when she remembered to get her verse
from the Bible and think about it, then asked
Jesus to keep her, and remembered, too, when
temptation came to call to Him to help her.
But some mornings she forgot all about it, or she
spent too much time curling her hair, or trifling
in some way till it was too late, and she had to
hurry down-stairs with all speed. There would
be time for it after breakfast, she thought, but
then it was put off from hour to hour, and perhaps
she ended by not doing it at all. When
this happened she was fretful and unhappy;
nothing went right with her. God made the
body so that it cannot go without food at regular
times, and keep in order. He made the soul in
the same way. It must get food from the Bible,
and by thinking about God and speaking to him,
or it cannot be a healthy soul. This poor little
Christian knew she must eat her breakfast or
she would feel faint and weak by ten o’clock, but
she had not learned that she must not starve
the other and better part of herself. So it was
no wonder that she did not always do right.</p>

<p>One reason why it was particularly hard now
was that two of her best friends were away.
Elmer Newton’s older brother was obliged, from
ill health, to spend the winter in the South, and
wished to have Elmer with him. Mrs. Duncan
felt anxious about her sick brother, and at the
last decided to accompany them and remain a
few weeks, which lengthened into months. This
made a lonely, gloomy time for Margaret, she
had come to depending so much upon their
help and counsel. She felt as if there was nobody
to go to with her troubles and doubts.
Mr. Wakefield was always kind, but she stood
in a little awe of him because he was the minister,
and so, unless strongly excited, was too
timid to talk freely with him.</p>

<p>When a girl of thirteen resolves to be dignified
toward any body it means that she is going
to make herself very disagreeable whether she
knows it or not. Amelia Barrows was not an
ill-natured young woman, and if Margaret had
tried she might have made a friend of her. As
it was, Margaret forgot that she was herself
several years the younger. She assumed airs of
importance, and found fault. She laid down
laws about her room, and called Amelia to account
if a brush or a chair was not in its exact
place.</p>

<p>“See here, young woman!” Amelia said one
day, losing all patience, “you’d better stop your
high airs. A piece of this room belongs to me
while I stay here, and I’m going to do exactly
as I please in it. I don’t want to be in it, or in
this house, either, but I’m here, and we’ve both
got to stand it. I never wanted my sister to
marry your father any more than you did,—not
as I have anything against him,—but I told
her she might as well put her head into a hornets’
nest as to try to manage three saucy young
ones. No wonder she’s sick!”</p>

<p>There is no telling what Margaret would have
said then if Amelia had not gone out and
banged the door after her. She was angry
enough to have said anything. To be called
“a saucy young one” when she had borne
everything, and was almost as tall as a woman;
it was too much!</p>

<p>“O, dear!” she sighed, bursting into tears,
“I wish she wasn’t here. She’s perfectly
horrid!”</p>

<p>When she went down to the well-cooked dinner
a couple of hours afterward she forgot to
ask herself how they could possibly get along
comfortably without Amelia.</p>

<p>There were afternoons when Amelia had leisure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to stay with her sister and Margaret was at
liberty. One day she went to take a walk, and
was sauntering slowly along when Hester Andrews
tapped on the window and beckoned her
in. Margaret hesitated. She had not been
going much with Hester of late, but she finally
went into the house. “You poor thing!” Hester
said, meeting her with a kiss, “I wonder if
you have got out at last! It is just too bad
for you to be shut up in the house all winter,
waiting on somebody who’s nothing to you; all
the neighbors say it’s a shame, and mother
says that it is entirely too hard for you.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 393px;">
<img src="images/illus027.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="girl alone by attic window" />
<div class="caption">SHE MUST BE ALONE SOMEWHERE.</div>
</div>

<p>Poor Margaret! She had been trying all
day to get the better of her discontent and ugly
feelings. Now, they sprang up anew. She
looked about the pleasant parlor where Hester
sat at her fancy work. Hester seemed to her
to have everything she wanted, and to do just
as she pleased. How different it was with her!
How hard her life was! It had
not occurred to her how hard till
Hester put it into words.</p>

<p>“If it was your own mother,
now,” Hester went on, “why of
course you would expect to do all
you could, but now, it’s just dreadful.
I’d like to see my father
put a step-mother over me if my
mother was gone—and make a
slave of me waiting on her! I’d
go out and scrub for a living first.”</p>

<p>Margaret ought to have known,
by this time, that Hester always
did her harm and not good, and
have had courage enough to shun
her company. She went into that
house in a good frame of mind;
she came away feeling that she
was a much-abused girl: one who
had a bitter lot; and she pitied
herself.</p>

<p>If Satan had hired Hester to
do some ugly work for him, to
spoil Margaret’s peace and draw
her away from God, it could not
have been better managed, for, besides
all the wicked things she had
said, she did something more. As
Margaret was about to leave,—after
having poured into Hester’s
sympathizing ears a long story
about Amelia and all she had to
bear from her,—Hester said,
“Wait a minute, Mag. I’ve got
a perfectly splendid book, and I’ll
let you take it, if you haven’t read
it. You’ve got to have something to cheer you
up or you’ll die.”</p>

<p>Margaret seized it eagerly. She saw at a
glance it was a novel. She had read enough of
them to spoil her taste for more solid reading,
and to know that she liked them far better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
anything else. She felt guilty in taking it, because
she had promised Elmer when he went away to
read only what would be of benefit. How did
she know, though, she told herself, but there
was something good in this book? She remembered,
too, with a twinge of remorse, that she
had not yet touched the books Mrs. Duncan left
for her to read, except to look through them
and pronounce them “dry.” She meant to read
them before the lady returned, but just now she
must have a real story to cheer her. Anybody
who has read “Madam How and Lady Why,”
“A Family Flight,” and “Harry’s Vacation,”
knows of what delightful reading Margaret had
deprived herself all this time.</p>

<p>The next morning when the room was in
order and Mrs. Moore was taking a nap, Margaret
brought her basket of work and drew up
to the fire, planning for a good time, not with
her mending, though. “The Deserted Wife”—Hester’s
book—was in the bottom of the
basket, well covered with stockings. The fact
that it was so hidden, and that she drew a tall
rocker between the bed and herself, proved that
her conscience was not altogether clear. However,
she was soon lost in her book. She did
not raise her eyes or move a muscle, except to
turn over the leaves for a long time; she even
forgot to breathe except by irregular gasps; she
read with feverish haste, because her step-mother
might waken at any moment and require
her help, and she must know what happened
next.</p>

<p>If Hester had but placed a live coal in her
hands instead of this book! She would have
dropped that instantly and have burned only
her fingers. This tale of sin and shame and
crime might leave scars on her soul forever.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore had an unusually long sleep, for
two hours had passed away when Margaret was
startled by her voice, saying,—</p>

<p>“Seems to me it is cold here. Has the fire
gone out? Where are you, Margaret?”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the wood fire had burned to
ashes, and the room was quite chilly. Margaret
hid away her book and went for kindlings.
They were wet, and the fire smoked and sulked,
but did not burn for a long time. Her father
came in to dinner before the chill was off the
room. He noticed it, for it was a raw, windy
day, and told Margaret, rather sharply, that her
mother’s room ought not to become cold like
that, and there was no need of it if she had
attended to the fire as she should. Margaret
could never bear to have her father speak sternly
to her. She went off to her room in a tempest
of tears, telling herself, amid sobs—as foolish
girls do at such times—that there was nobody
to love her.</p>

<p>This was only one of the many difficulties she
brought herself into during the next few weeks.
She plunged into a perfect whirlpool of novel
reading. As fast as one book was devoured
Hester provided another. She read “The Fatal
Marriage,” “The Terrible Secret,” “A Bridge of
Love,” “Lady Gwendoline’s Dream,” and “Lord
Lynn’s Choice,” besides many more. She read
while she was dressing, and snatched every moment
through the day. She even sat up nights
and pored over those fascinating books, when
she should have been sleeping. Sometimes she
stole out in the evening and walked up and
down the street with Hester, and talked them
over. So she constantly lived in another world.
She was in a frenzy of eagerness to get through
whatever she was doing, and drown all her
senses in a book. As a natural consequence,
nothing went well with her. She hated her lot
and its duties. She longed to get away and
live with the beautiful, unreal people she had
read about.</p>

<p>Novel-readers are usually cross. Poor Margaret
was very cross. She disputed constantly
with Weston, and boxed Johnnie’s ears when
he teased her. He turned everything into
rhymes, so when he had succeeded in putting
her into a rage, he would leave off singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Aunt Ameliar,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She’s a pealer,”</span></div>
</div></div>

<p class="unindent">and would dance about Margaret, shouting in
her ears,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Mag is mad,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And I am glad.”</span></div>
</div></div>

<p class="unindent">This would make Margaret very angry, and
sometimes the two had what Amelia called “a
scuffle.” She would interfere at last and declare,
as Johnnie ran off laughing, that Margaret
was the “worst of the whole pack if she was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
church member. She would rather be nothing
than a hypocrite.”</p>

<p>And Margaret in these days was impertinent
to her step-mother and jerked things about in a
way that is very trying to a sick person. She
left undone all she possibly could, allowed great
holes to come in her stockings, and went about
slip-shod, with the buttons nearly gone from her
shoes, and did not take the “stitch in time”
that “saves nine.” There were worse neglects,
too.</p>

<p>Since this fatal disease of novel-reading had
come upon her she did not read her Bible
scarcely at all. On Sunday afternoons she held
it a while and gazed out of the window, then
went hurriedly through a chapter without knowing
a word that was in it. As if the Bible
would do one any more good than the geography
unless its words were understood and treasured
up.</p>

<p>It was the same with prayer. She forgot it
entirely, or she murmured a sentence or two
while she was running down-stairs in the morning
or after she was in bed at night. It was
mere form, and not true praying at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Wakefield had been sadly perplexed
about Margaret. He felt sure, from what he
saw and heard, that all was not well with her.
She seemed to avoid him, and whenever he had
an opportunity to speak with her she said as
little as possible, and got away as soon as she
could. What evil influence could be at work
upon her? Not her step-mother’s. He felt sure
that if Mrs. Moore but knew how, she would be
glad to help the girl. One evening as he walked
homeward he was thinking about Margaret, and
wondering what he could do to help her. As he
came near Mr. Andrews’ house somebody came
out of their gate and ran down the street just
in front of him. As she passed the lamp-post,
and the light fell full upon her, he saw that it
was Margaret. As she turned in at her own
gate a book slipped from under her arm and fell
to the ground, but she did not know it. She
hurried up the steps and closed the door after
her. Mr. Wakefield picked up the book, slipped
it inside his coat, and went up to his own room;
then he lighted the gas and sat down to see
what sort of a book it was which would surely
help or hinder this young Christian. He read
enough to satisfy him that he had found the
clue to Margaret’s difficulties. What soul could
thrive on such mental food? “Satan is at the
bottom of it!” he said, half-aloud, flinging the
book from him. He sat a long time with his
face between his hands, thinking.</p>

<p>The next evening, after tea, Mr. Wakefield
lingered in the sitting-room and asked Margaret
to try some of the pieces in the new Sabbath-school
hymn-book. Margaret’s cabinet organ
had been her mother’s, and was now a source of
much pleasure to herself. She had learned to
play sacred music nicely, so she and the minister
often sang together. Johnnie sang a few minutes
and then ran off. When they were left
alone, Mr. Wakefield stepped into the hall and
came back with the book he had picked up the
night before.</p>

<p>“Margaret,” he said, “can you imagine to
whom this belongs? I picked it up on the
street last night.”</p>

<p>Now Margaret had been greatly troubled
about the book all day; she knew Hester would
be angry with her if it were lost, so it was with
a sense of relief that she read the title, “Disinherited.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m so glad you found it,” she exclaimed,
then stopped and blushed. She had a feeling
that perhaps Mr. Wakefield would not quite
approve of this sort of reading, and she had not
meant to let him know that she ever read such
books.</p>

<p>She felt very uncomfortable, and stood with
her eyes on the carpet, waiting for him to lecture
her severely, but he did nothing of the
kind. When she looked up, his face and his
tones were kind as he asked,—</p>

<p>“Do you love to read, Margaret?”</p>

<p>“Better than anything,” promptly answered
Margaret.</p>

<p>“Do you like books of this sort—novels?”
he continued.</p>

<p>She studied the pattern of the carpet a moment,
and twisted one of her curls, then said,
almost defiantly,—</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wakefield forgot that he had meant to
be very calm and gentle, and he said almost
fiercely, as he walked back and forth,—</p>

<p>“O you poor child, I wish I could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
saved you from this. Margaret, do you know
what a horrible thing this novel-reading is; how
the thirst for it is like the thirst for liquor? It
drives out the love of Christ from the heart.
It ruins souls! But there! I did not mean to
frighten you,” he said, as the tears gathered in
Margaret’s eyes. “Sit down and let us talk the
matter over calmly. Let me tell you how near
I came to being ruined by that trap of Satan’s
myself.”</p>

<p>Just here the door-bell was heard, and Johnnie
brought in Deacon Grey who had called to see
the minister, while Margaret slipped out of the
other door.</p>

<p>She flew, rather than ran, up-stairs. She tip-toed
softly through the hall, for she did not wish
any one to see her just then. As she went by a
door which stood ajar, she heard her own name,
and unconsciously paused. Her step-mother’s
voice was saying:—</p>

<p>“We’ve got to make some different arrangements.
Margaret gets worse every day. I’ve
tried to be patient, but some days she acts like
a little fury. Amelia says she sits up nights to
read novels. I talked to her about it, and she
just the same as told me it was not my affair.
I thought it was all nonsense, her joining the
church. What do such children know about
it? I guess you had better send her to your
aunt’s if she wants her. We can get along
somehow.”</p>

<p>Then her father’s voice groaned out,—</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know what is going to become
of her.”</p>

<p>Margaret waited to hear no more. She
turned to go into her own room, but Amelia
was there; growing desperate, she went back
into the dark hall and softly opening the door
that led up garret, groped her way up the narrow
stairs. She must be alone somewhere. It
was a long, wide garret stretching over the
whole house. This was the old homestead of
the Moore family, and “take it up garret,” had
been said of all the lame furniture and not-wanted
articles for a whole generation. It was
a cheerful place by daylight; a capital place for
a romp; but to-night it looked “pokerish.” The
tall chimneys reared themselves like grim giants
at each end; old hats and coats hung from the
rafters, and the moon, looking in at the gable
window, made dancing shadows on the floor, of
the long, bare branches of the elm-tree.</p>

<p>Margaret had never been up garret in the
dark before. She would have been afraid if she
had not been in such a tumult. She flung herself
upon an old chest by the window, and cried
out her mortification and anger in long, deep
sobs. The moon beamed down in a kindly way,
and the eye of God looked upon her in love and
pity, but the poor child did not know it.</p>

<h2>THE CONE.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">YOU may plant the cone of a California
Pine in a vase of earth, and cover it with
a glass, and set it in your window to catch the
sunbeams, and keeping the earth moist the pine
will grow until it reaches the top of the glass,
and it will search all around to find some way
out of its prison, and will press with all its vital
force toward Heaven. But the glass resists the
pressure, and those little branches turn back to
earth, the stunted pine soon withers to the very
root.</p>

<p>But plant that cone in its native soil, and
give it showers and sunshine, and it will lift its
branches higher and higher, for thousands of
years, until it forms the loftiest pile of verdure
on the face of the earth. So a man may plant
his hopes on a little spot of earth, and close himself
in with the covering of earthly pleasures,
and for awhile he may long to break through his
prison walls and come forth to a freer life. But,
in the end, if he keeps his covering on, his
growth will be downward and dwarfed. But
let him break forth from the contracted circle
of a worldly life, let him cultivate hopes worthy
his immortal destiny, let him look upon God as
his Father, and himself as the heir of boundless
creation, and he shall grow in greatness and in
joy; “he shall be made a king and reign forever!”</p>

<h2>OUR TIGER.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-n.jpg" width="51" height="111" alt="N" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">NOW, dear children, do not expect a terrible
story of a wild animal, for our
Tiger was only a dog.</p>

<p>When Jennie and I were little, we
teased our papa for a dog to play with,
and one night our hearts were made glad by his
bringing one home to us. It had been living in
one of the large freight depots in Boston, and
had been so teased by little urchins, that often
lounge about such places, that he was fast getting
to be very cross and snappish, so it was
thought best to get rid of him.</p>

<p>He never outgrew his dislike for boys, and
would not allow them to touch him at all, but
would often chase them, and sometimes bite
them if they came on the premises. This hatred
extended even to the youngest children,
and from a little boy baby he would walk away
in disgust, while he would allow a little girl to
pull him about without a word of complaint.</p>

<p>At one time we had an old cat which was
determined to rear her three little kittens in the
closet of mamma’s room. The kittens were repeatedly
carried back to the cellar, and as often
Mistress Puss would find some way to take her
family back to the closet. Tiger had evidently
been watching the whole operation, and decided
to take affairs into his own hands, as you
will see when I tell you what happened.</p>

<p>One day, Bridget, the cook, saw him go
through the kitchen with something in his
mouth. She followed carefully after him, and
what do you think she found? You cannot
guess, I know, so I will tell you. Tiger had
brought down the kittens, one by one, in his
mouth, and carried them into the back yard,
where having dug a hole for each, they had been
placed, and carefully covered with dirt. Bridget
rushed into the house, and said to us, “Oh!
do come out in the yard, Tiger has made a cat’s
cemetery.” We hurried out to see what she
could mean, and found her words were true.
There stood Tiger looking at his work, seeming
to feel very proud to think he had found such
an effectual way of keeping the kittens out of
mamma’s closet.</p>

<p>Tiger was not always so cruel as this, but
sometimes showed great fondness for other animals.
My papa kept many sheep, and one
spring there were two little lambs born that
were disowned by the mother sheep. Of course,
it would not do to let the little things die for
want of care, so they were brought to the woodshed,
and put under my mamma’s protection.
They were soon named Dicky and Biddy, and
being fed often with warm milk from a bottle,
they grew rapidly. From the first Tiger showed
a great liking for the pet lambs, and would
stretch himself out on the floor by the side of
the basket, where he would remain for hours at
a time.</p>

<p>One day after Dicky and Biddy had grown
quite strong he got them out of the basket on to
the floor. How this was accomplished we could
never quite tell, but I am quite sure they had
some way of making each other understand, so
that he coaxed, persuaded and encouraged them
to go beyond the narrow limits of the basket,
and see more of the world. After a while they
were not contented to roam about the shed, but
extended their journeys to the yard, and sometimes
away down the street.</p>

<p>This last habit would have proved a very
troublesome one to us, if it had not been for
Tiger’s assistance in bringing them back. We
had but to say, “Tiger! Dicky and Biddy have
run away. Go find them,” and away he would
dash down the street after them. When he
overtook them they would all stand for a few
minutes as though there were an explanation of
the case being given, and then he would turn
around and run home with both lambs meekly
following him. I have watched him many times,
and I never knew him fail to bring them back.</p>

<p>My papa used to go to Boston every day and
return at evening on the horse-cars, and Tiger
could usually be found at the gate to meet him.
Although these cars were constantly passing the
house, Tiger never made the mistake of going to
meet an earlier or a later train, but a few minutes
before the customary time for my papa’s arrival,
Tiger could be seen going leisurely down the
walk to be in readiness for the expected greeting.</p>

<p>At last Tiger commenced to get old, and did
not like the active sports of his youthful days,
but much preferred to stay in the house and lie
by the fire. Being fond of the company of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
family, he would often creep into the sitting-room,
and quietly settle himself on the hearth-rug,
when mamma would sometimes say, “There
is some one here whose room is better than his
company.” Without another word Tiger would
get up, and, with tail down, and a sidelong
glance at mamma, he would sneak, in a crestfallen
manner, to the door to be let out. Finally
when he got to be quite old he was sick and
died, and it was one of the sad days of my
childhood, when we buried him under the apple-tree
in the orchard.</p>

<h2>GRANDFATHER.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">“GRANDFATHER” is the name of an old
parrot, owned by Mr. W. H. Seward, Jr.,
of New York. This parrot has been a great
traveller in his day, but now lives quiet at his
home on the Hudson River. His master is very
fond of him, and so are all the family; and he
is the pet of all visitors who go to the house.</p>

<p>Several years ago, when there was a dreadful
war in our beloved country, Mr. Seward lived
in Washington, where his father then held the
office of Secretary of State.</p>

<p>At that time the “John Brown Song” was
all the rage. The very boys in the street would
sing, as they went along, “John Brown’s body
lies moldering in the grave,” and other lines,
ending with the chorus, “Glory, hallelujah!”</p>

<p>“Grandfather” would listen and try to sing
it; but all he could learn was the “Glory, hallelujah!”
which amused the family very much.
After a while he seemed to forget even this,
although he learned many new things.</p>

<p>Many years passed. Mr. Seward had gone to
his own home on the Hudson River. The war
was over, and the old campaign song of “John
Brown” had passed out of the people’s minds.</p>

<p>The aunt of Mr. Seward, who had lived with
him in Washington, and had not seen the parrot
since, came to make the family a visit; and
in asking after the health of all of them, said,
“Don’t tell ‘Grandfather’ I’ve come; I want to
see if he will remember me.” Then she went
into the room where the parrot’s cage hung, and
going up to it, said “Good-morning, ‘Grandfather.’
How do you do? Do you know me?”</p>

<p>“Glory, hallelujah!” said he.</p>

<h2>THE POPLAR ST. PANSY SOCIETY.</h2>

<div class="author"><span class="smcap">By C. M. L.</span></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE brave girl was now full of hope that
a good day was about to dawn for the
P. S. P. S. Uncle John was there. He
had said as much; and what could not
he do?</p>

<p>The members must each be visited and urged
to attend the meeting and hear what Uncle
John had to say.</p>

<p>She would undertake it. Of course they
would be so glad to hear that the Society was
now to be revived and go on finely again. So
she thought.</p>

<p>With a light heart and face full of sunshine
she started on her way.</p>

<p>The first ring brought a servant to the door,
only to say that the children had just gone
away for some days. The next door opened
promptly as she still held the knob in her hand,
but only to assure her that Carrie was not well—probably
could not go out for weeks. The
third call found no one at home.</p>

<p>A fourth was answered with, “My! I thought
the P. S. P. S. was dead. But I’ll see what
mamma says. Maybe she’ll let me come.”</p>

<p>A little further on Jennie met an old member
and laid before her Uncle John’s plans for a
meeting, and all about it, only to receive a stare
and, “Who is your Uncle John?” And the
inquirer, without waiting to be told, went skipping
on her way.</p>

<p>Sometimes Jennie was told, “Don’t get me
to any more P. S. P. S. poky meetings;” or,
“Oh! I’m invited to a card-party the very night
of your meeting. Of course I must go. And
there’ll be dancing and ice-cream, and ever so
much fun;” or, “Mamma says I can never attend
any more,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>A sunny sky is sometimes overcast and the
rain falls instead of beams of light.</p>

<p>Do not blame Jennie if she cried. It was
such a sharp disappointment.</p>

<p>Thus far not one word of encouragement.
Every one seemed to frown upon her, and all
the laughing she met or saw on either side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
streets through which she passed, seemed to be
at her expense. She was mistaken, but a heavy
heart often feels a sting where there is really
no stinger.</p>

<p>What shall she do?</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Jennie; I told you so,” came
from one of the committee boys, who happened
to follow her track and overhear some of the
rebuffs received by Jennie, and who now came
up by her side to put the last straw upon her
breaking heart. “What’s the use?” he went
on. “They say you are making yourself ridiculous,
and—” and he was about to add another
straw when they turned a corner and met
Uncle John coming towards them. Without
noticing her face, he took Jennie by the hand
and turned up another street, leaving her companion
to go his way.</p>

<p>Uncle John went on to say how he had
thought of little else besides the Poplar Street
Pansy Society and now he was all ready for the
meeting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 509px;">
<img src="images/illus043.jpg" width="509" height="400" alt="igloos" />
<div class="caption">SNOW HOUSES.</div>
</div>

<p>A little further on the other member of the
committee was met, who reported that he had
called upon some of the others, but no one had
promised to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>But blessed Uncle John cheered Jennie by
saying it was always darkest before the day and
that no matter how matters had turned out this
time, it might be just the contrary to-morrow.</p>

<p>So the tears were wiped away, and the young
heart said, “I’ll try again, for Jesus’ sake.” That
night she went and told Jesus. The next day
there was joy in store for her. Not one laughed
or mocked. Some said they would come and
bring others.</p>

<p>Sure enough. Jennie must needs bring in
twice as many chairs as were arranged for the
meeting.</p>

<p>Everything being ready, Uncle John began:</p>

<p>“A long time ago there lived in one of our
large cities a—Mr. Riddle. He was a banker.
But no matter about him. I am now going to
describe another member of the Riddle family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and if you will sharpen your wits and be wide-awake
some of you good guessers can guess who
or what he is, and I will promise you he will
take you into copartnership and let you share
his riches.”</p>

<p>At this point every eye began to open at the
thought of suddenly growing rich.</p>

<p>“He was born before Methusaleh,” continued
Uncle John, “and”—the eyes opened still
wider—“he lives now;” at which not only
were the eyes open to their utmost, but many
mouths, and questions came thick and fast:
“Born before Methusaleh?” “Lives now?”
“Do you really mean it just so?” “How can it
be?” “Who ever heard of such a thing?” “Is
not it a conundrum, or a puzzle, or a riddle,
or”—</p>

<p>“Yes,” from Uncle John; “and if you will
listen closely and do some of the best thinking
of your life you will surely guess my riddle.”</p>

<p>“And share the riches you spoke of?” asked
one.</p>

<p>“And share the riches, just as I said.” And
here Uncle John looked around, silent and
amused at the perplexed faces of the young
folks.</p>

<p>Then he continued: “This Mr. Riddle will
probably live hundreds of years more. He was
and he is a banker, richer than all other bankers,
the Rothschilds thrown in to boot. There isn’t
a place in all the world where he has not a bank.
Some are hundreds of feet in the earth; some as
high in the air; some, built of iron; some, of
silver, tin, glass, paper, dirt, ice, clouds, coal
and much more of which I may tell you more
by and by. This is enough now. Don’t ask me
any more questions to-night. We will sing a
verse of a hymn, and have a short prayer, and
then you must all go promptly home and to bed
and be up early to-morrow morning and do all
the sharp thinking you can get time for, and
come again in the evening at seven o’clock, and
I will tell you more about this puzzling banker,
Mr. Riddle.”</p>

<p>Then Uncle John’s rich voice led, and,
“Praise God from whom all blessings flow,”
filled the room and swelled hearts with new
and strange thoughts.</p>

<p>Then they all joined in “Our Father,” etc.,
and the meeting was out.</p>

<h2>HOW BENNIE WAS TEMPTED.</h2>



<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-b.jpg" width="49" height="113" alt="B" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">BENNIE crawled out of his bed that
morning with his mind full of the
thought of apples.</p>

<p>“The harvests are getting mellow!”
so Jack Burnes had announced the day
before, and every boy knows just what that
means to all the boys who are so unfortunate as
to have no harvest apple-tree to climb and
shake. After the climbing and shaking comes
the scrambling down and the picking out of the
fairest and best, and then comes the stuffing of
pockets and the gradual, though not very slow,
process of transferring from the pockets to the
stomach. To all such unfortunates it means an
indescribable longing, an unutterable desire to
climb somebody else’s harvest apple-tree! It
means an uncontrollable appetite which only harvest
apples can satisfy. You all know how Bennie
felt. There was no apple-tree in his father’s
garden; how could there be when there was no
garden! The place which Bennie called home
had no advantages in that direction, being two
or three rooms in a rickety old tenement house.
Now Bennie went to Sunday-school, and he had
learned the Lord’s Prayer, and he never forgot
to repeat it as he lay down at night upon his
not very luxurious bed; and I think that Bennie
understood what it meant when he prayed
“Give us this day our daily bread,” for he had
sometimes known what it was to want for daily
bread, but when he repeated “Lead us not into
temptation,” his ideas of that for which he
asked were rather vague. That morning he
started out with hair uncombed, face unwashed;
with a ragged coat and battered hat and walked
directly towards temptation in the shape of Mr.
Vinton’s harvest-tree with its loaded limbs
hanging over the wall. To be sure he knew
that trespassers were threatened with the constable
and the jail, but then he thought maybe
some apples will have dropped over the wall
into the road in the night, and if I get there
first why “I’ll have them if there are any.
What’s in the road belongs to folks as finds ’em
first!” And so he hastened along until he
stood under the overhanging branches. There
were no “finds” on the ground, and as Bennie
looked up into the tree the thought of climbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
up the wall and filling his pockets came to him.
Why not? There were plenty of apples; the
Squire would never miss a few; as for getting
caught, it was too early for any of the family
to be about. That sign was meant for boys
who wanted to carry off a lot of apples; he
meant to take only a few. And so reasoning,
dallying with temptation, poor Bennie was overcome!</p>

<p>Not more than five minutes later Bennie lay
helpless upon the ground, half-buried under
the broken branch and the fallen sign.</p>

<p>“It is a wonder you weren’t killed outright!”
said the Squire’s man who came to pick him up.
“As it is I guess the harvest apples and the
Astrachans and the pippins, too, are safe from
you for this year! Where do you live, youngster?”</p>

<p>A broken arm and a sprained ankle! not long
in the doing, but what a long, weary time was
the undoing!</p>

<p>“The little rascal! serves him right!” said
Mr. Vinton when told of the accident. “Send
Dr. Grant down to set the arm, and tell him to
attend to the boy, but don’t let May hear of it.
She will be in a worry if she gets hold of it.”</p>

<p>But when was there a case of suffering among
the poor, especially in her vicinity, that May
Vinton did not get hold of sooner or later? It
was not many days before Ellen appeared at
Bennie’s poor home with a basket of necessaries
and delicacies for the boy’s comfort, and asking
if there was anything further needed. In the
basket was a quantity of great mellow-looking,
yellow harvest apples; but when Bennie saw
them he turned his face away and said, “Take
them away! I don’t want to see any harvests,
ever! It was good of Miss Vinton to send
them, but I can’t bear them! It seems just as if
they had printed all over them ‘Thief! thief!’”</p>

<p>Poor Bennie, his sin had found him out!</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTIONS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-h.jpg" width="56" height="98" alt="H" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">HIS name is Bobby Williams, and he is the
boy who stands with smiling face, and
hands in pockets, watching the huge
snow ball being rolled to its place.</p>

<p>He has been doing something besides
watch; not a boy in the crowd worked harder
than he, until he was red in the face and quite
out of breath, and two others came to take his
place; then stood Bobby in the biting northeast
wind, watching.</p>

<p>You should have seen that same boy at midnight,
or a little later. Sitting bolt upright in
the big chair in his mother’s room; a hurried
fire burning in the grate; his feet in hot water
up to his knees, his hands in hot water up to
his elbows, spoonfuls of disgusting stuff being
poked down his throat every few minutes, and
his very wail in protest,—so hoarse that
you would have been in danger of mistaking
it for the voice of the big dog out in the back
kitchen.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the doctor would never
reach there, and when he came, as though he
did nothing; and when something was really
done, and Bobby was somewhat relieved, it
seemed as though the weary night would never
be gone.</p>

<p>But it was, at last; and Bobby, pale and
limp, with flannel about his neck, and a smell
of pork and oil in the air, was tucked into his
mother’s bed, and listened to the merry jingle
of the school bell.</p>

<p>Then said the tired mother: “Bobby, how was
it all; did you get very warm yesterday, playing?”</p>

<p>“I guess I did!” replied Bobby hoarsely;
“I never was so hot in my life! We was rolling
a great big snow-ball; the biggest we ever
made.”</p>

<p>“And when you stopped rolling, what did
you do?”</p>

<p>“I stood still and watched the other fellows,
four of them; it was as much as they could do
to move it an inch.”</p>

<p>“Stood still in the sharp wind, all in a perspiration,
I suppose! And did you have your
overcoat on?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” said Bobby hoarsely, his cheeks
growing red for shame. “I forgot.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you remember, Bobby, how often
I have told you not to stand still, out in a cold
wind, when you are warm?”</p>

<p>Said Bobby, “I forgot.”</p>

<p>Now the truth is, that you are very well acquainted
with Bobby, for that night’s work for
father and mother, and grandma, and auntie,
and the doctor and himself is a fair specimen
of what Bobby can do for the discomfort of the
world; and the words on his lips in excuse for
all sorts of heedlessnesses, and even downright
disobediences, are always “I forgot.”</p>

<p>Oh, me! What a “forgetter” has Bobby!</p>

<h2>THE OLD BRIMMER PLACE.</h2>

<div class="author"><span class="smcap">By Margaret Sidney.</span></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-y.jpg" width="76" height="88" alt="Y" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">“YES, dear.”</p>

<p>Mother Brimmer smiled and nodded,
and Rosy ran off for a basket.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” cried
Cornelius, seeing her turn over the turkey drumsticks
in the platter, when the basket, lined
neatly with brown paper, was all ready and
waiting on a chair. So Mother Brimmer began
to explain.</p>

<p>“Oh! now, I say that’s too bad,” cried Cornelius,
“to give away a lot of things to those
fellows who pitched into us in our shop, and
egged me most to death, besides making me
sprain my ankle. Don’t let her do it, ma,” he
begged.</p>

<p>“But Mr. Plumtree made them sorry about
fighting in the shop,” said Rosy, continuing her
selection of pieces, “and they had to work
awfully hard at the farmer’s where he bound
them out; and now they’re all so poor, I don’t
suppose they’ve had the least bit of a Thanksgiving
dinner.”</p>

<p>“They don’t deserve any,” said Cornelius
stoutly. Even Jack looked as if he thought
Company’s sentiment wasted.</p>

<p>“I told her she might,” said Mrs. Brimmer
quietly, the guests looking on with no words to
offer.</p>

<p>“Look at her,—she’s putting in an awful
lot,” shouted Cornelius, hanging over the turkey
platter. “Rosy, don’t give ’em <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>“That” was half of an apple tart, rich and
red, and juicy.</p>

<p>“Probably the first they’ve ever tasted,” said
the minister softly.</p>

<p>Jack rubbed the toe of his boot back and
forth over the polished wooden floor, Miss Clorinda
gave a mild sniff of disapproval of the way
things were going on, but by pinching herself,
she managed to keep still; Corny alone, keeping
up the other side of the argument.</p>

<p>“It’s a perfect shame, when it’s the first time
we’ve ever had a Thanksgiving,” he cried, with
a red face and indignant eyes, “to pack off all
those nice things to a lot of dirty, mean old Corner
boys.”</p>

<p>Mother Brimmer still kept silent.</p>

<p>“Jack thinks so.” Corny whirled around and
pointed to the senior partner triumphantly. “He
knows; and you ought to do as he says, Rosy.”</p>

<p>Company’s little right hand dropped to the
side of the basket, while her round face took on
a pained expression as she looked at Jack.</p>

<p>The big boy flushed up to his dark hair, and
he dropped his eyes to the floor to follow the
working of his uneasy boot. He longed to say
“I think it’s ridiculous, when we are all working
so hard, to give away such things to those
idle, good-for-nothing Corner boys,” but a verse
from the Bible came ringing through his ears.
For a moment, he thought the parson must be
repeating it, and he glanced up quickly. No;
there he sat in the high-backed chair looking at
him silently. Then Jack remembered it was
in church that very morning that he had heard
the words “Do good to them that hate you.”</p>

<p>Here was the direct command from the Master.
Jack in the past year of work and responsibility,
had drawn very near to his Heavenly
Father; at the last, glad to enroll himself as a
member of the Church of Christ. And, yet, on
this blessed day of thankfulness for the wealth
of mercies that had been showered upon him, he
was avariciously shutting his heart to the good
impulse that would help some of God’s poor,
needy ones, up into the range of human sympathy
and love. They might be wicked; all
the more reason that he should do what he could
to bring them to love the good. Mean, contemptible
fellow that he was to even look his
disapproval to what Rosy was doing!</p>

<p>Jack threw back his head, and Cornelius gave
a long breath of delight.</p>

<p>“Go on, Rose,” said the big boy of the family,
“and I’ll help you.” Thereupon Jack sprang
forward, and seized an orange and laid it in the
basket, and followed with two or three handfuls
of butternuts.</p>

<p>“Ow—ow!” cried Corny in despair.</p>

<p>“Come on, Corny,” cried Jack, his color
deepening into a bloom to match that in Wild
Rose’s cheeks, and his dark eyes dancing with
delight, “if you want any hand in this basket;
see, it’s almost full.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>And the next thing that Corny knew, he was
tucking in the drumsticks of the chickens, that
he had fondly hoped to pick clean on the morrow;
and Jack had saved himself from being
the one to pull down the sweet impulses of his
younger brother and his little sister, into the
mire where all was hateful and of evil growth.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said the parson, when all the
packing was done, even to the tying of the string
across the cover, “that you don’t want my company
on your walk over to the Corners—eh,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“Don’t we, though,” cried the boy, never the
least bit afraid of the minister; now, warmed
up to self-forgetfulness, in a mood light-hearted
enough for anything.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we do!” echoed Corny, whipping
out his knife to cut off the string-end. “That’ll
be just gay, if you’ll come.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we all accompany the basket party,”
proposed Miss Peaseley slowly, and taking her
feet away from the cheerful blaze of the snapping
hickory; “that is, those who care to,” she
added, with a thought in time for the widow
and her daughter, and lame Joey Clark.</p>

<p>Joey looked wistfully across at his sister;
but she shook her head, and he sat back obediently
in the depths of his chair.</p>

<p>“Want to go, Joey?” asked Mr. Higginson.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Joey’s thin cheek glowed at once,
and his eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“Now, I feel just like a ride on this cold
afternoon,” declared Parson Higginson, jumping
up, and swinging his arms. “I’m going over
cross lots to ask Farmer Hooker to lend me his
green wagon and Betty the mare. Want to go,
Jack and Corny, and help harness?” Both boys
signified without any hesitancy, that they did.</p>

<p>“Joey, you have the first invitation,” said the
parson, nodding over at the lame boy; “get all
bundled up in fine style,—and all you others,”
waving his ministerial hands merrily toward the
group; “follow suit, and we’ll pick you up in
about ten minutes—oh! here’s my coat; thank
you, Jack, and Rosy, for my hat. Come on,
boys!”</p>

<p>And so, what was supposed to be rather a
hard and unwelcome duty of trudging down to
the Corners with a heavy basket containing some
of the Thanksgiving goodies, turned out to be,
under the minister’s management, the most
royal frolic of the season, and one well suited to
wind up a Thanksgiving party with.</p>

<p>And then came Christmas.</p>

<p>There was no party at the old Brimmer place,
of course. Mother Brimmer would have held
up her hands in amazement at such an idea.
One festive occasion was quite enough to indulge
in for a year, and the memory of it would
follow each day of the twelvemonth, with inspiration
to heartier work than ever.</p>

<p>“It’s Thanksgiving all the year,” said Corny
one day, well along in December. “Didn’t we
have a good time? I haven’t got the taste of
those pies out of my mouth yet,” and he
smacked his lips.</p>

<p>“Those were the most economical pies I ever
made,” said Mrs. Brimmer, laughing, “they last
so long.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to pretend,” said Corny, nailing
away vigorously on his mother’s washboard,
which a rainy day had allowed him to mend,
“that we’re going to have some more on Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Better not,” said Mother Brimmer wisely,
“for you’re not going to, and when the time
comes you’ll be disappointed.”</p>

<p>“No, I sha’n’t, Mamsie,” said Cornelius decidedly,
“’cause I know you aren’t going to
make any. But I remember just how they
tasted, and when I’m pretending we can have
’em all over again, it’s ’most as good as eating
any.”</p>

<p>“It’s a very cheap way of getting a nice dish,”
said Mrs. Brimmer, cutting up her meat for the
stew, “but I don’t think sham pies are as good
as the plain boiled dinner we’re going to have
Christmas.”</p>

<p>Cornelius pounded away a few moments in
silence; then he said, “I suppose we ought to
do something for Christmas; that don’t take
money, I mean,” with an anxious glance at his
mother.</p>

<p>“Well, now, children,” said Mrs. Brimmer,
neatly dividing an obdurate joint, “there, that’s
done. I’ve been thinking about Christmas, and
a plan has come to me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell till Jack comes,” cried Rosalie,
over in the corner busy with her ironing holders.
“O, Mamsie, do wait!” she begged in alarm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jack knows about it,” said Mrs. Brimmer;
“he and I talked it all over the night you two
went to singing-school. And he wanted me to
tell you both as soon as I could get a good
chance. Now’s the time, I think, seeing Roly
Poly is having her nap, and we three are all
quiet together.”</p>

<p>“O, Mamsie! what is it?” cried Rosy breathlessly;
and, dropping her sewing, she ran up to
her mother’s side, Cornelius also deserting his
washboard.</p>

<p>“Go right straight back,” said Mother Brimmer,
clapping the potatoes into the kettle, “and
pick up your work—dear me! can’t you hear
just as well when your fingers are busy, pray
tell?”</p>

<p>Thus reproved, they hurried back again.
“Now tell, do, Mamsie,” they begged, once
more in their places.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Brimmer slowly, “it’s
just this; Roly Poly must hang up her stocking
the same as usual, of course.”</p>

<p>“But do let it be a better one this year,”
cried Corny, “old turnip dolls, and such make-believe
stuff as it was last Christmas!” he added
contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Roly Poly had a beautiful time,” said Rosy,
“she’s been talking of it most every day since.
Don’t you remember what fun it was seeing her
pull out the things?”</p>

<p>“And the doll, I’m sure, was a wonderful
affair,” said Mother Brimmer, “and lasted much
better than a store one would have done.”</p>

<p>“And when it wrinkled it looked just like an
old woman,” said Corny, with a shout at the remembrance;
“and how funny it was to hear
Roly Poly call it her baby.”</p>

<p>“And wasn’t the molasses candy with the
butternuts meats good,” observed Rosalie reflectively,
“and the furniture you and Jack
made for the dolly—oh! I think that was so
pretty.”</p>

<p>“And the mittens Mamsie knit her; I forgot
them,” said Corny. “Yes; it was pretty good,
after all. But we’re richer now, and we ought
to give her a better stocking this Christmas,”
he added decidedly, with quite an air.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about being richer,” said
Mother Brimmer cautiously, and giving a final
stir to the several ingredients in the kettle, she
put on the cover, took down her pans and set
about moulding her bread; “our expenses increase
every year as you children grow older;
and it isn’t right to plan taking anything that
isn’t actually necessary, out of the nest-egg.
Roly Poly will need every bit we can give her
toward her education by and by.”</p>

<p>“We aren’t being educated,” said Corny deliberately.</p>

<p>Mother Brimmer turned away from her bread-board,
looked at him keenly, then sent a swift
glance over to her one girl.</p>

<p>“And that’s just what I want to talk about
this morning. You’re going to have a chance
at it, if you both agree to the plan.”</p>

<p>It was impossible for the children to work
now; and the needle and the hammer dropped,
while Mother Brimmer went on.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thomas will come here every evening
for an hour, for a dollar a week, and teach Jack
and both of you; and I’m to have the chance
of listening and asking questions, so you might
as well call me a scholar, too.”</p>

<p>Neither of her auditors said a word, but
stared into the strong face, out of whose mouth
was issuing such wonderful words.</p>

<p>“There will have to be hard work on your
part to make every minute tell,” said Mother
Brimmer, “as you’ve got to keep your books
by you and study when you get a chance. But
the most important of all, is to keep saying the
things you learn, over and over to yourself, so
that you can’t forget them; I wouldn’t give a
cent that any child of mine should get anything
into his or her head, that can’t stay by them,”
she added, with a scorn to match that of Cornelius’
own.</p>

<p>“We never’ll forget what we once learn,”
cried both Corny and Rosalie in one breath.
“But how are we going to pay for it, Mamsie?”</p>

<p>“Well, now to pay for the lessons, we shall
all have to sacrifice something,” said Mrs. Brimmer,
drawing herself up to her full height, and
looking resolutely at them.</p>

<p>“We can give up our play—afternoons,”
said Corny slowly, his black eye steadily on her.</p>

<p>“Never!” exclaimed Mrs. Brimmer, bringing
her hand down on the table with emphasis,
“those mustn’t be touched, whatever we do;
that’s decided.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“What can we give up?” cried Rosy, in
astonishment.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">JOEY.</span><br />(<i>See <a href="#BABYS_CORNER">Baby’s Corner</a>.</i>)</div>
</div>
<p>“We’re saving everything as close as can be,
now,” said Cornelius, with a decided nod.
“Jack turns every penny twice over before he’ll
begin to think of spending it, and then he claps
it into the bank. What in the world can we
save more, ma?”</p>

<p>“I said ‘sacrifice,’” replied Mrs. Brimmer,
very distinctly. “We shall have to draw out
some of the nest-egg. This will come hard, because
all of us have been working diligently
to put the little fund there, and every cent
taken away from it reduces the interest.”</p>

<p>Cornelius began to look grave at once. Rail
as he might at Jack’s regard for every penny,
the accumulation of the deposit in the bank was
is dear to the heart of the younger boy, who
had no delight so great as an errand that took
him past the large, red building, over whose
door was the magical word—Bank. To stand
here a moment and reflect that nearly one hundred
dollars was recorded on the books to the
credit of Brimmer Brothers and Company, repaid
for many hours of toil and self-denial.
Now, if they had a teacher, some of that slowly-accumulated
money must be used.</p>


<p>It was to be a sacrifice, as the mother had
said.</p>

<p>“But,” Mrs. Brimmer’s tone changed to a
ringing one of hopefulness and courage, “the
money thus taken out and used, will be the best
investment possible; better than a ten per cent
interest for all of us. Think of it, children; an
education for you and for me!” and for one
little moment, the barriers of a pent-up longing,
that had possessed her heart for years, were
dropped.</p>

</div>

<p>“Mother,” they cried, “let us have Mr.
Thomas come just as soon as he can!”</p>

<p>“He can’t come till Christmas Eve,” said
Mrs. Brimmer. “But he’ll begin then, and be
glad to, for he’s too poor to go home for a vacation.
So he told me yesterday, when I stopped
into the District school.”</p>

<p>“Is that where you went, Mamsie, in the
afternoon, when you put on your Sunday shawl
and bonnet?” asked Rosy, who hadn’t recovered
from the astonishment produced by seeing
such preparations made for a visit about which
there was no attending conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes, child; I asked Jack about it, first;
and then he wanted, if Mr. Thomas could do it,
to have me tell you and see if you would like to
fall into the plan. If Mr. Thomas couldn’t do
it, why, then, you two wouldn’t have any disappointment
to bear. But he can. O, what a
Christmas we will have!”</p>

<h2>THE RAILROAD ON MT. PILATUS</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">IF the Rigi Railroad is worthy of being considered
an extraordinary and wonderful
piece of work, the latest undertaking of this
kind—the building of the railroad on Mt.
Pilatus—certainly ought to attract the attention
of engineers and of the travelling public.
This new road differs essentially from its older
rivals in the construction of its roadbed, as well
as of the rolling stock. The ruggedness and
steepness of the mountain, together with its
great height (sixty-eight hundred and eighty-two
feet, against fifty-nine hundred and five, in
the case of Rigi), offered much greater obstacles
than the roads previously built, and
required an entirely different system. The restless
spirit of man is always glad to set for itself
some new task, and consequently men were
found who, equipped with the necessary capital,
were willing and able to carry out this tremendous
undertaking. When a portion of the road
had been completed, all fear in regard to strength
and safety were removed, for it was thoroughly
tested every day, the locomotives going as often
as it was necessary to that part of the road on
which they were at work, carrying materials of
all kinds, weighing from twenty thousand to
twenty-two thousand pounds. The southeastern
side of the mountain was chosen for the road,
which begins at Alpnach-Stad, between the Hotel
Pilatus and the Eagle Hotel (one thousand four
hundred and forty-eight feet above the level of
the sea). From there it climbs in a northerly
direction to the Aemsigenalp, then westward to
the Mattalp (fifty-three hundred and fifteen feet
above the sea), and after much winding reaches
the plateau of the Hotel Bellevue on Mount
Pilatus (sixty-eight hundred and eleven feet
above the sea). The road is about two and
three quarters miles long, and the total height
climbed from the shore of Alpnacht Bay to the
Hotel Bellevue is fifty-three hundred and sixty
feet. The grade is from eighteen to forty-eight
per cent., which is scarcely exceeded by any
rope road. In the middle of the line, at Alp
Aemsigen, there is a switch. Seventy-two hundred
and sixty-seven feet of the entire road consists
of straight stretches, curves with radii of
from two hundred and sixty-two feet to three
hundred and twenty-eight feet, constituting the
remainder. The road includes a viaduct, three
short tunnels and one long one. The width of
the track is two feet seven inches. The foundation
consists of a wall covered with plates of
granite and loose material, and on this the
superstructure is firmly anchored. The tooth-bar—which
is placed midway between the
rails and is somewhat higher than the latter—consists
of soft steel, and is provided with a
double row of vertical teeth, which are milled
out of the bar. The cogged wheels on the cars,
which engage the toothed bar, are arranged in
pairs at the right and left of the same. The
axles of these cogwheels are not horizontal
with the level of the road, as in the Rigi system,
but perpendicular to the same, this arrangement
making it impossible for the cogwheels to become
displaced. The locomotives and cars form
a train with two running axles and four cogwheels
engaging the toothed bar. The boiler
and engine are behind or below the cars, which latter
accommodate thirty-two passengers. Brakes
can be applied to all of the cogwheels, and
besides this there are two clamps at the upper
running-axle, which clutch the head of the rail,
thus preventing the upsetting of the cars by the
wind. The weight of the loaded cars is about
twenty-one thousand pounds, and one trip up
or down can be made in about eighty minutes.
The idea of the Pilatus road originated with
Edward Locher, under whose supervision and
control the road has been built. The engine
was invented by Mechanical Engineer Haas.—<i>Illustrirte
Zeitung.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recent</span> discoveries have settled the vexed
question of the former existence of lions in
Australia. Bones from the Wellington Caves,
New South Wales, are regarded by Professor
Owen of the British Museum, as being those of
a marsupial or pouch-bearing lion, fully equal in
size to the existing African species. These remains
were found in connection with those of
the Tasmanian Tiger and Tasmanian Devil.
Quite curiously, Professor Owen many years
ago expressed the conviction that certain ancient
herbivorous animals of Australia must have
been kept in check by a co-existent race of
lions.—<i>Selected.</i></p>

<h2>VALUE OF ARABIC NUMERALS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">FEW people, probably, have any adequate
idea of the great difficulties in which
arithmetic would be involved were it not for
the happy invention of the Arabic numerals.
Here is a very simple little sum in addition put
Roman fashion.</p>

<p>The reader will find it “a nice amusement,”
as the model papa always tells his daughters, to
work it out as it stands without having recourse
to Arabic notation:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="roman numbers">
<tr><td align="right">MDCXLVIII</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">MCCXLV</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">DCCXXXIX</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">MDCCCLXXXIV</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>None of these figures reach two thousand,
and yet what a hopeless task to sum
them up without an abacus! But that is,
indeed, a small matter. Here are two better
tests of the impossibility of arithmetic without
Arabic notation:</p>

<p>Multiply (all in Roman figures) MDCCXLIV
by DCLXXXIV, and divide MCCXLIII
by XLV. Nothing could be simpler
than these two sums, and yet it requires
considerable intellect and very close
attention to work them out on paper with
the Roman symbols.—<i>Cornhill Magazine.</i></p>

<p class="drop-capi">JOEY and Jamie are two little bits

<p>They live in a nice house and

<p>One little boy is just as old as the other

<p>When they stand up to see how high they

twins.</p>

<p>They look as much alike as peas in a pod.
Only Joey has big black eyes and Jamie has
blue ones.</p>

<p>They have good times playing when they are
good. Sometimes they are naughty. Joey is
naughty most.</p>

<p>One day last summer they were playing by
the little brook where the flowers grow. The
water said “tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,” as it ran over
the stones.</p>

<p>They were happy for a little while. They
picked flowers and put their fat hands in the
cool water.</p>

<p>But at last Joey began to pick up stones and
throw them. One little white stone hit Jamie’s
blue eye. It hurt him. He cried. Mamma
came and took him on her lap and kissed his
eye.</p>

<p>Then it felt better.</p>

<p>Joey sat in mamma’s lap a long time and ate
some big red cherries. They were sweet and

<h2>A BOY FROM THYATIRA.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">TWELVE years ago a little boy,
only thirteen years old, stood bidding
his mother good-by.</p>

<p>He was going a long journey with
strangers across the ocean, to stay a
good many years. He didn’t know
how long it would be before he should see his
dear father and mother again.</p>

<p>He had very black eyes and hair, and beautiful
white teeth, and his skin was somewhat
darker than yours when you’ve been playing
bareheaded in the sun. For the rest, he was a
little Armenian boy, born and reared in Turkey,
and speaking the Armenian language. His
father was a native preacher in Thyatira.</p>

<p>And now this boy was to take a long, long
journey to America to be educated, so that he
might come back to work for the Jesus whom
he loved so much.</p>

<p>It was very hard to say good-by for so long a
time, but at last it was over, and the boy went
down to the great ship that was to carry him
over the ocean, trying to choke back the tears
that would rise when he thought of his home
and father and mother and playmates, and the
missionaries whom he loved so much. So he
knelt down by his little bed in the ship, and
begged the dear Heavenly Father to go with
him. Then there came a sweet verse to him
to cheer him: “Fear thou not, neither be thou
dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee,
whithersoever thou goest.”</p>

<p>He was very much bewildered when he landed
in this country, at all the bustle and hurry, and
the strange language.</p>

<p>He was put immediately into school, and went
to work at the English language.</p>

<p>“Did you find it hard?” I asked him, not
long since.</p>

<p>“Hard! I should think I did,” he answered.
“Your language is so queer! See that horse
tied to a tree. It is ‘fast.’ And yet if he is
running at full speed you call him ‘fast.’ That
window is locked. You say it is ‘fast,’ but so is
the young man that smokes and drinks, and
wears flashy neckties and carries a cane. It was
a great puzzle to me at first. It has taken me
all these twelve years to learn it.”</p>

<p>The boy has worked hard, and is a fine
scholar.</p>

<p>Five years ago he went back to his own country
and spent a year in Smyrna among the
Greeks, and now if you chance to have the
pleasure of spending an evening in his company,
he may take his guitar and sing to you the wild,
sweet melodies of the Greeks, with their soft,
musical syllables, and I’m sure you’ll be delighted
with them.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, he may give you the Turkish
call to go to Jerusalem, and describe the caravan
of Armenians as they start on their pilgrimage
to the Holy City, with a young man ahead
on a beautifully-adorned camel, his head thrown
back, his hands clasped at the back of his neck,
and singing out the weird call which means
something like this:</p>

<p>“Come all ye people! Let us go up to visit
Jerusalem! It will please all the saints! I
have sold all my vast estates to fit me out for
the journey. I have given up everything! Be
not behind your leader! Come, let us go up
and we shall be saved!”</p>

<p>He will tell you, too, of his little brother, who
has just started to this country to be educated.
How often he will jump upon some barrel or
box in the street and imitate the Mohammedan
call to prayer, with such exactness that his
mother is obliged to pull him down quickly and
take him into the house lest some angry Mohammedan
should seize him and punish him for
his fun.</p>

<p>The young man is now studying medicine and
expects to return to his own country soon, to
begin work for his Master.</p>

<p>Shall we not all pray that his work may be
blest, and that many may be brought to Jesus
through him?</p>

<h2>NOT LOST ON THE AIR.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">A VERY interesting incident occurred in
the early ministerial life of Mr. Spurgeon,
and which he verified to the person who made
it public. Thirty years ago or more, he was
invited to preach in the vast Crystal Palace at
Sydenham. Would his voice fill the immense
area? Resolving to test it, he went in the morning
to the Palace, and thinking for a passage of
Scripture to repeat, this, as he reached the stage,
came to mind: “It is a faithful saying, and
worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners.” Pronouncing
the words, he felt sure that he would be heard,
and then repeated the verse in a softer tone.
More than a quarter of a century later Mr.
Spurgeon’s brother, who is also a pastor, was
called to the bedside of a man, an artisan, who
was near his end.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” asked the pastor.</p>

<p>“O, yes!” answered the dying man, with
assurance.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me how you obtained the salvation
of your soul?”</p>

<p>“It is very simple,” said the artisan, his face
radiant with joy. “I am a plumber by trade.
Some years ago I was working under the dome
of the Crystal Palace, and thought myself entirely
alone. I was without God and without
hope.</p>

<p>“All at once I heard a voice coming from
Heaven which said “It is a faithful saying, and
worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners.” By the
meaning of these words I was convinced of sin;
Jesus Christ appeared to me as my Saviour. I
accepted Him in my heart as such at the same
moment, and I have served Him ever since.”</p>

<p>God honors his Word. Suppose Mr. Spurgeon
had used a secular sentence to try his
voice? What surprises await the faithful when
results are known.—<i>The Watchword.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">“NEW MEXICO is peopled largely by a
superstitious, ignorant race, intensely
bigoted, and under the almost absolute sway of a
degraded priesthood, who have a deadly hatred
of the spelling-book as well as of Christian instruction.</p>

<p>“For centuries the people have dwelt in isolation,
separated from civilization by vast reaches
of barren, waterless, cactus-bearing plains. During
these centuries they have made no advance
either mentally or morally, but have sunk deeper
and deeper into the sloughs of ignorance.
The mission schools established among the Mexicans
are centres of light from whence radiate
many cheering rays. The people are awakening
to a sense of their degradation, and give evidence
of their desire for improvement. Many
are anxious to learn English and to have their
children educated. A little plain furniture, such
as chairs, tables and bedsteads, is finding its
way into their houses, and more attention is
paid to dress and cleanliness.”</p>

<h2>LOTUS LILIES.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE lotus lily is spoken of as “the peer-less
flower of Farther India.” From an
article, which is too long to give you
entire, I shall cull some interesting
items about this flower for your benefit.</p>

<p>It is a kind of water lily, and is considered a
wonderful flower by the people of the countries
in which it is found. In Egypt it was once considered
sacred to their gods, and in India the
Hindoo gods are often represented as seated upon
the expanded flower. In China and Japan it is
closely connected with Buddha, and has a large
place in the worship of that god. In China the
lotus lily symbolizes womanly beauty, the small
feet of women being called <i>kin leen</i>, or golden
lilies.</p>

<p>The petals of the lotus lily are rose-pink,
growing brighter and redder toward the tips,
where one can almost imagine the life-blood of
the flower is oozing out, and will soon drop upon
the white mat of the table. Opening the rosy
lips, the golden heart of the flower is disclosed
surrounded by a silky fringe of the stamens of
the same bright hue, edged with pure white
pollen. The leaves of the plant are dark-green,
almost round, and lie or float upon the bosom of
the lake. The stems are like long green serpents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
rearing their spiral forms from the black
ooze beneath the water, and holding aloft their
banners of green and blossoms of beauty and
fragrance.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the fact that the plant is
held sacred, many of the Chinese cultivate it
for sale. The fragrant blossoms reach a diameter
of ten inches, and find ready purchasers.
The seeds are used as an article of food; sometimes
eaten raw, sometimes ground and made
into cakes.</p>

<p>The fleshy stems are used as a vegetable,
while the fibres of the leaf-stalks serve for lamp-wicks.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians used to inclose the
seeds in balls of clay or mud and cast them into
the Nile, and in due season the plant appeared,
followed by buds, flowers and seeds. Does that
make you think of a Bible verse?</p>

<div class="caption">ON THE NILE.</div>
</div>

<p>In Siam the lotus lilies grow in great profusion,
and one may sail for miles along the
rivers through flooded fields covered with the
lotus blossoms, which the natives are gathering
for market.</p>

<p>Then there are the royal lotus gardens of
Bangkok. These are several miles from the
king’s palace. There is a carriage road leading
out from the city, and these gardens are a
famous place for picnics. At the grand funeral
ceremonies of the Queen of Siam, one of the
companies which walked in the procession carried
tridents, the triple tips of which were each
crowned with the white lotus. Every year
thousands of real and artificial lilies are floated
on the rivers and sea as offerings of the water
spirits.</p>

<p>They are launched at night, with little wax
tapers burning, and they are loaded with offerings
to the gods.</p>

<p>Many beautiful fancies cluster about the lotus,
and many songs have been written, which you
may appreciate the more if you happen upon
them, for knowing something about the beautiful
fragrant flower “trembling on the crystal tide.”</p>

<h2>THE YEAR OF OUR LORD.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE following incident which occurred, as
will be seen, many years ago, has lately
been published, and is from the experience of
Mr. Duncan, a well-known missionary to the
Indians of British Columbia. He says:—</p>

<p>“I was teaching the Indians to write letters,
and, as a matter of course, began at the name
of the place at which the letter was supposed
to be written. About that step there was nothing
to call forth any remark from the Indians.
Next came the name of the month. That
elicited some smiles, but no questions. Then
was added the day of the month, which also
caused some interest, but no surprise. When,
however, I added 1860 for the year, immediately
the Indians inquired what did those figures
mean, and why was the year so named? For a
moment I was stunned at the answer which the
question called for. Never before had I realized
the startling meaning of those figures in
connection with the Gospel, and how severely
they witnessed against the Christian Church.</p>

<div class="caption">BEIRUT.</div>
</div>

<p>“The Indians seemed at once to seize with
awe the information I offered on the subject, and
their looks but too plainly indicated both reproach
and astonishment that the message of God
should have been withheld from them so long.</p>

<p>“I felt both ashamed and humiliated for my
race, and wondered how so many generations of
Christians since the apostolic age, could have
dared, as they have done, to so willfully and
fatally neglect, or, at best, but trifle with their
Lord’s commission.”</p>

<h2>“THE EVENING STAR.”</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the large playground of a Christian school
in Beirut is an arbor where several girls of
the school were accustomed to meet just at sunset
for a prayer meeting. They had organized
this meeting by themselves, and one day the
teacher asked, “What do you call your meeting?”</p>

<p>“Oh! we call it the ‘Evening Star,’ because
when the sun sets the evening star comes out,
and so, when the sun sets our little meeting is
held, and we have named it the Evening Star.”</p>

<p>“And what do you pray for at the ‘Evening
Star’?” asked the teacher.</p>

<p>“Oh! we pray for our teachers; but especially
we pray for a new heart.”</p>

<h2>GOWAHATIS.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">IN the western part of the State of New
York there is a territory known as the
“Cattaraugas Reservation.” This is the
home of the Senecas, one of the tribes of
the Iroquois, or Six Nations of Indians of Western
New York. There were six tribes that in
the early history of our country formed a confederacy
or union, and were sometimes called
the Huron-Iroquois; one tribe was called by the
Dutch “Sinnekaas,” which at length became
“Senecas.” A secretary of the board of missions
connected with one of the leading religious
denominations visited the Reservation a
year or so ago, and he tells us many interesting
facts connected with these Indians and concerning
the work of the missionaries among them.
Fifty years ago most of these people were benighted
Pagans worshiping false gods, but to-day
there is probably not a dozen persons among
the four thousand who have any veneration for
heathen worship. This does not mean that all
love and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. When
you say that you live in a Christian land or in
a Christian community, you do not mean that
all the people in the land or in the community
are real Christians, but you mean that all or at
least the most of the people believe in Christianity.</p>

<p>Now how did it come about that these ignorant
worshipers of false gods have become a
Christian nation? You are not surprised to
learn that it has been brought about through
the efforts of a few earnest and faithful missionaries
who have given their lives to the work of
lifting up this people. But it is the story of
Gowahatis that I started to tell you. She was
the step-daughter of Red Jacket, a noted Seneca
chief, who received his name from wearing
a scarlet coat given him, during the Revolutionary
War, by a British officer. Red Jacket
was bitterly opposed to the Christian religion,
to missionaries, schools and teachers. This step-daughter,
Gowahatis, was called “Aunt Ruth”
by the missionaries.</p>

<p>Her Indian name was significant of her position
as leader of a certain dance performed by
women alone. It was very honorable, and constituted
her a sort of “chief” woman. Both
mother and daughter strongly sympathized with
Red Jacket in his opposition to the introduction
of the religion of the pale faces, until, having
been induced to listen for once to the preaching
of the missionaries, they perceived its superiority
to their faith and desired to know more of
the wonderful salvation which the Son of God
had wrought out for all men—Indians as well
as white men. They went again, but this coming
to the ears of the old chief, he positively
forbade them, threatening that if they disobeyed
he would leave his family at once. The mother
was very much alarmed, and for a time she
ceased her visits to the mission house. But
after a time she and her daughter took their
blankets out into the woods one Saturday evening
and hid them. The next morning they
walked away from the house slowly, as if going
out to the woods, and when they came to the
blankets they threw them hastily over their heads,
and by a circuitous path made their way to the
meeting.</p>

<p>There they heard the words, “God so loved
the world that He gave His only begotton
Son, that whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
This brought them to decide, once for all, to
take the Gospel and risk the loss of all things.
This was a great step; Red Jacket would do
what he had said: he would leave the family;
this they knew. He was a very distinguished
man; as his wife and daughter they had been
much noticed and had received many presents,
but they would renounce all for Christ and everlasting
life.</p>

<p>They joined the mission church, were very
earnest Christian women, they remained faithful
unto death, and exerted a powerful influence
in bringing others to Christ. A year or two
after Red Jacket returned to his wife, and
acknowledged that he had done wrong in leaving,
adding that he did not think that she was
any the worse for being a Christian.</p>

<p>Dear Pansies, this thought came to me as I
heard the story of these Indian women: they
heard the truth once and were interested, twice
and accepted.</p>

<p>How many times have you heard it? Have
you accepted Christ?</p>

<h2>THE PERSECUTED BANNERMAN.</h2>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[In one of the missionary magazines I read this note: “There
is one story in the foreign missionary department of this number
which none of our young readers should overlook.... It
is a first-rate story to read and talk about in the family.”
Turning over the pages I found, as I had expected, that the
editor’s suggestion was a good one, and then I immediately
became desirous that all you young people of the Pansy should
have a chance at the story, and here it is, clipped for your benefit.—<span class="smcap">Faye
Huntington.</span>]</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">NG-HIN-KI a young man of more than usual
ability and energy joined the Third Presbyterian
Church in Canton in September, 1881.
His foster mother was bitterly enraged at him
for so doing, and all his brothers were greatly
displeased. They made strenuous efforts to
prevent him from attending church and from
performing his religious duties, but without success.</p>

<p>Their persecution, especially that of his foster
mother, became so bitter that in the spring of
1882, he was given the place of door-keeper
in one of our chapels, one hundred and thirty
miles from Canton, receiving for his services two
dollars and fifty cents per month. In the autumn
of the same year he received a letter from an
elder in the Third Church, advising him not to
return to Canton, as his foster-mother and brothers
had brought a charge against him of being
<i>unfilial</i>, which in China is a very serious crime.
Their object was to get him discharged from his
position as bannerman. Instead, however, of remaining
away from Canton, he at once returned,
saying he would go at once and meet the charge.
He found on arriving that all his property, one
shop and three dwelling-houses, had been sold for
fourteen hundred dollars. He was brought before
a military officer and ordered to light three
sticks of incense and place them before an idol.
He was told that if he obeyed, the draft for fourteen
hundred dollars lying upon the table would
be restored to him, but if he refused he would
lose not only that and his monthly allowance,
but his betrothal, which had cost him three
hundred dollars, would be made null and void,
altogether that which he would forfeit would be
what is for a Chinaman a comfortable and permanent
livelihood. Sign and save, refuse and lose.
He refused and was cast out penniless. He entered
the training school, and after three years
of faithful study was appointed to preach. He
is now doing a useful and encouraging work
three hundred miles from Canton, at Sam
Kong, near Lien Chow. Until near the close of
last year this man’s relatives refused to have
anything to do with him, when, much to his
delight, a great change took place. They became
not only willing to welcome him home,
but to hear him make known the Gospel. It
came about in this way: one of his brothers at
a tea-shop had seen a member of the Third
Church, also a bannerman, telling the people
about Jesus.</p>

<p>One of the company in anger struck him
a blow in the face, telling him he need not
come there to preach to them. He smiled
and went on with his discourse. Ng-hin-ki’s
brother was much surprised. He knew the
speaker was naturally high-tempered, was physically
strong, and was no coward. In fact he
knew perfectly well that what prevented the
bannerman from striking back was not fear, but
principle. This won his admiration for the man
and respect at least for his message and was the
occasion of bringing about in his family the
changed feeling mentioned above.</p>

<h2>A PRODIGAL SON.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">I HAVE opened one more school, a mile from
the road. I had to walk that distance.
Those burning days it was pretty severe, as the
road lay over sand hills and plowed fields. The
school was so nice, the children so happy, one
could not remember the discomfort.</p>

<p>An old Mohammedan priest tried to break it
up, and did compel some to withdraw their children,
but the school is secure.</p>

<p>Several women came in to see Miss Sohiba
and watch the school. The Bible lesson began
from a picture of the Prodigal Son, hung on the
wall. An old lady listened; her face sobered,
tears filled her eyes; finally, amid broken sobs,
she declared—</p>

<p>“O, Miss Sohiba, that is my boy! That is
my boy!”</p>

<p>Most touchingly she told how he had gone,
how she had watched and waited for him, but
he never came back.—<i>Extract from Miss
Pratt’s letter from India.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> hear from the Secretary of a Band in
India of how they are educating two Mexican
girls, whom a missionary has taken to educate
for teachers. Who knows what great food this
seed may start?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Mission Band</span> in Brighton, Massachusetts,
made over one hundred dollars in a fair held
last May. There were fancy articles and refreshments
sold. Twenty dollars were voted to
the “Fresh Air Fund,” and twenty more to
some home missionaries in the West. [We are
indebted to Miss Bessie Cotton for the report.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> the readers of <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> heard of
the natives of the Charlotte Islands, ignorant
and benighted, who gave, one Sabbath, one
hundred of their blankets, valued at one dollar
and twenty-five cents each, toward the erection
of a new church? If we consider the resources
and ideas of this people, it was truly a great
gift, and a good example for any Americans.
[We have to thank Adella F. Coy for calling
our attention to this most interesting item.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Nolo, Iowa, there is a very busy mission
band, of nine members, which is making up a
box for a hospital in Council Bluffs. They are
earning money in various ways. Some gather
eggs and have one out of every dozen, some
have raised chickens, one little pigs. One boy’s
father offered him ten cents apiece for all the
squirrels he would catch on the farm. But so
many poor nut-crackers became prisoners that
the price came down to two and one half cents.
The Band held a Lawn Festival, at which they
sold various refreshments, and made thirteen
dollars. They are knitting stockings, hoods,
and mittens, dressing a doll and piecing a comforter.
Success to all who “are not weary in
well-doing.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the streets of large mission stations of
Japan, there are rooms open all day, in charge
of the missionaries, where the heathen may
learn of the true religion. A countryman entered
one of these stations and had a long talk
with one of the missionaries,—whom it was
our pleasure to meet this summer. When he
went home he was a Christian. Some weeks
afterward the missionaries received a letter from
him. He wrote: “We have here a church, Sabbath-school,
prayer-meeting, etc., all composed
of one member. I get along nicely, except for
the Communion Service. And if you could
send me by mail a bit of the bread you use
could I not have a service all by myself?” The
bread was sent, and some time later the convert
wrote back how much he enjoyed the Communion
Service, all alone, with Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> young people of a certain church in the
West, had a chance not long since to give an object
lesson and did it well. One of their number
who had been long absent from home, soon
after her return, made an entertainment for her
friends; delightful music was to be expected,
and some other enjoyments of a special character.
The invitations were sent out for Friday evening;
to the lady’s disappointment, one, and another
and another, of those whom she specially
wanted, politely declined the invitation; they
were sorry not to be with her; under other circumstances
nothing would give them greater
pleasure, but for that evening they had a previous
engagement. On being pressed as to what
it was, they explained that it was the evening for
their regular young people’s prayer meeting!
Their friend was so astonished at this reply,
that she took some trouble to learn whether the
young ladies had known of one another’s intentions
in declining her invitation, and found that
each had acted without knowing what the other
meant to do. Don’t you think she must have decided
that in the minds of some people the prayer
meeting was an important place, and the engagement
to attend it was not to be lightly broken?</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MERRY CHRISTMAS to all my Blossoms!
Glad am I to be able to give
you this happy greeting once more. And to
the many new faces which I greet for the first
time, the wish is just as hearty; may each of
you have this month, not only the merriest, but,
in the truest sense of the word, the best Christmas
you ever enjoyed in your lives.</p>

<p>Shall I tell you how to make sure of this? I
dare say you know, but I will just repeat the
thought to keep it before your minds. In the
first place, let each of you make a Christmas
gift, very costly and very precious, to the best
friend you have. Now I see many sorrowful
faces, and hear low, regretful voices: “You
would like to, but you have no money to spend,
or at best but very little, and cannot afford anything
costly.” Is that what I hear you say?
Mistaken, every one of you. The most costly
and precious thing in the world, is the strong
true heart which has its home in your body, my
boy—or my girl. I want you, this Christmas
month, to give it away to the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>No matter if you have done it before. I am
glad to know that many of you have. Just
renew the gift. Choose some quiet hour, and
go alone, and, on your knees, say: “Lord Jesus,
I give myself anew to Thee, in return for Thy
great Christmas gift to me. I give Thee my
time, and my strength and my will. I ask Thee
to direct me all day, and every day, in the way
in which Thou wouldst have me go. And I
promise to use my tongue to speak for Thee,
and my hands to work for Thee, and my feet to
do errands for Thee, and my heart to love
Thee.”</p>

<p>I wonder how many will use this prayer, and
mean each word in their hearts? Just so many
will be sure to have a happy Christmas, and a
happy year.</p>

<p>One other thing: Some of our Blossoms
have been transplanted during the year that is
past. God has sent his angels and gathered
them to bloom in His upper garden, where
flowers never wither. Now, while we are glad
for them, shall we not remember the homes from
which they have gone? The dear fathers and
mothers and brothers and sisters, who cannot,
sometimes, keep the tears from coming, because
they miss their darlings so? Will not every
Pansy Blossom ask the dear Lord to help and
comfort these sorrowing hearts?</p>

<p>Now, just one thing more: What can you
do on Christmas Day which will make somebody
else happier than he or she could possibly
have been if you had not done it?</p>

<p>Think it out, my Blossoms, “something for
each of you now to do.” Then, set to work and
do it; then write and tell me all about it, and
I’ll weave all your letters into a story for next
year’s <span class="smcap">Pansy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mamie Fuller.</i> You must keep some of the
writing you do now while you are six years old,
and put it by the side of what you do when
you are sixty. I guess you will see great progress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
And I hope you will come very near the
Lord Jesus in that time.</p>

<p><i>C. R. Richmond.</i> A picnic in a beautiful
grove; five hundred present; a brass band;
oranges, ice-cream, lemonade; talks by Revs.
King and Adams; a bountiful dinner following,
etc., etc. It seems as though Master Colin and
his companions must have gone home with sunny
hearts and faces, and in love with the S. S.
Did you?</p>

<p><i>Minnie Locket.</i> When a dear little Pansy
writes as well as ever he or she can, they need
not ask me to excuse their penmanship or anything
else about the writing. All I care to
know is that they do their very best. No one
can do more, and so there is no room for an
excuse. Do your best, Minnie, every time, and
you will not be ashamed.</p>

<p><i>Jessie P. Davis.</i> Whenever your <span class="smcap">Pansies</span>
fail to come, write to D. Lothrop Co., 32 Franklin
Street, Boston, Mass. Do not think that any
Pansy can be so small as not to be missed. The
baby is the smallest body in the house. Don’t
you think it would be missed?</p>

<p><i>H. C. Withey.</i> The monkey game you send
must be very funny, but its length and the difficulty
of “doing” it here will explain why it
does not appear in the <span class="smcap">Pansy</span>. Perhaps you
will try again, and send something very short
and easily played. The Pansies will be interested
in anything of that sort from Africa.</p>

<p><i>Lolo Keeling.</i> Don’t despair whatever may
come. Carry your failures to Jesus. Try
again. Triumph will come.</p>

<p><i>M. Nellie Lindsey.</i> Thank you for remembering
to write to me many times, even if you
did “forget to send them off.” And what in
the August magazine pleased you so much besides
that letter?</p>

<p><i>Fannie W. Ambler.</i> Let me commend you
for plain writing. The Queer Story is well
done, though with some mistakes. Try again,
my dear.</p>

<p><i>M. Lillie Read.</i> Your Queer Story is much
like Fannie’s, almost, but not quite, right.
Never mind; there’s another for you. Don’t
be afraid of it. Don’t be cast down over any
failure, but up and at it again. Train the baby
to be a true Pansy. I’m so glad you make any
progress.</p>

<p><i>Nellie Wright.</i> “Nine years old.” Said and
done a thousand things or more in that time.
Now, suppose you live to be ninety,—my dear
uncle has just died at ninety-two,—and you
keep on saying and doing, then how many thousand
will it be? But all the better if it be all
for Jesus’ sake. I like Florida, and you must
like Kansas, which gives you “lots of corn and
fruit.”</p>

<h2>EXTRACTS FROM PANSY LETTERS.</h2>

<div class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy:</span></div>

<p>From a tiny child, May, if told to do anything,
would do it just a little differently. If
told to put a thing on the table, she would say,
“I dess will put it on lounge,” and when I
answered, “No; on the table,” she would skip
along, laughing, “I dess will put it on chair.”
But doing a little differently from mamma’s way
and God’s way will end in many a heartache<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Pray that mother and child may yield impliably
to the dear Father’s will.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span class="smcap">May</span> and her <span class="smcap">Mamma</span>.<br />

<p>This is one of my compositions:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<div class="center"><small>A PAPER OF NEEDLES.</small></div>

<p>First, a coil of steel wire, twenty-four inches
long. This cut through the middle by scissors
into little curved bundles, long enough for two
needles. Straighten and point them—on a
grindstone. They are pointed at both ends.
They must now have their eyes opened.
Needles, like puppies and kittens, are born blind.
They are stamped with a heavy die that leaves
the print of two needles’ heads and eyes at the
center of the wire. Then the eyes are opened
with a double punch.</p>

<p>I am eight and cannot write well. I tried

said, “Wait, I will help you.” I have taken
your paper since I was a bit of a girl, and love
it, and can hardly wait till it comes.</p>

<p>I have many, many, many naughty traits.
Send me a badge. It may help me. Mamma

<p>Ella Smith was six years old. Her mother
told her to take care of the baby while she went
up street. Ella went into her mother’s room
for the baby. The bureau drawer being open,
she thought she would take a peep. Naughty
Ella! in it lay three large oranges. How good
they looked! She said to herself, “I will just
touch them.” They felt so mellow she took
two large bites. When her mother came, she

<p>We have a beautiful location. Looking south,
we see the little valley with Keiser Creek, like a
thread, bright and clear; on either side, the
rocky hills, with pines, separated by deep ravines.
Away beyond the foot hills, overtopping all, is
the Yellowstone or Snowy Range, lifting up their
white tops on the hottest days, as if in derision.
Rocks are everywhere. “The Rockies” are
rightly named. Several miles down the river
is “Pompey’s Pillar,” on the rocky face of which
is carved the name of Wm. Clark, 1806, the explorer.
Not far is the battle-ground, on which
the gallant Custer and his men lost their lives
by the Indians.</p>

<h2>THE STENOGRAPH.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">A CONTRIVANCE, by M. M. Bartholomew
of New York, weighing about
three pounds, costing forty dollars, about the
size and shape of a man’s hand, with five different
keys and a roll of narrow paper, something
like a spool of silk, designed for “fast
writing,” is the Stenograph; so named, because
that is the meaning of the word in Greek.</p>

<p>This queer little creature can make its mark,
that’s all. But it can do it so quickly and put
it in so many different places and orders when
its fingers are touched by wire and spry human
fingers that it can write all your pen can write
and do it in a fraction of the time, while the
operator’s eyes are looking away into the face
of the speaker whose words are being taken
down.</p>

<p>Then, you can learn to “make it talk” in
three months!</p>

<p>Suppose, now, some of you Pansies manage in
some way to own a Stenograph and teach the
dear to mind the moment you speak to it. It
would be a delight to you to play upon it as
upon your piano. Besides, it would probably
make music for your pocket. There is money
in it. You would be in demand at conventions
and other places as a reporter of speeches and
sermons. And you could command good pay,
if you were a good stenographer.</p>

<p>Who knows but some of you will get your
“bread and butter” by means of this queer
little creature?</p>

<h2>NEW BOOKS.<br />

(<i>Published by D. Lothrop Company.</i>)</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">True Manliness.</span> By Thomas Hughes.
Price $1. I want to say a word about this book
to a certain dear little girl I know who has a
whole dollar with which to buy papa’s Christmas
present, and who cannot decide what to
buy. She knows papa likes books better than
almost anything else, but then, how should a
young girl know what book to select for a man
who has gray hair?</p>

<p>My darling, I feel sure papa would like this
very book. It is the reason I selected it from
a large number of others, to tell the Pansies
about, because I thought of you and your dollar.
A very pretty book in a deep maroon binding,
with three hundred pages of reading matter,
and all of it put in paragraphs so that a busy
man, who has but a few minutes to read, can
seize this volume, get some sweet and helpful
thoughts from it, during the five minutes when
he is waiting for the mail, or for the street-car,
and then go on his busy way. Just the thing
for your hurried papa, don’t you see? In fact
the book belongs to a set, named “The Spare
Minute Series,” gotten up for just such waitings
as I have described.</p>

<p>“Would the book be ‘nice’ for you to
read?”</p>

<p>Well, no, little girlie, I’m inclined to think it
would be rather “grown-up” for you, because,
you see, it was written to help your grown-up
papa and mamma. There are bits in it that
you would like; and your fifteen-year-old
brother would often read words in it that would
please and help him. I open the book at random,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and find these words under the heading of
“Courage.”</p>

<p>“After all, what would life be without fighting,
I should like to know? From the cradle to
the grave, fighting, rightly understood, is the
business, the real highest, honestest business of
every son of man.</p>

<p>“Every one who is worth his salt, has his
enemies, who must be beaten, be they evil
thoughts and habits in himself, or spiritual
wickednesses in high places, or Russians, or
Border-ruffians.”</p>

<p>Don’t you know your brother said, only a few
days ago when he got cross and things went
wrong, that he felt as though he should like to
<i>fight</i> somebody?</p>

<p>Here is his chance, with directions how to
carry out his wish.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="smcap">A Chautauqua Idyl.</span> By Grace Livingston.
Price 75 cents. The queerest little Chautauqua
story you ever read! All about a new Chautauqua
which is to be; one in which the birds and
the flowers, and the fishes, and the squirrels, and
all that lovely out-door life at which we look on,
are deeply interested, as indeed they may be,
for they are the prime movers. You couldn’t
guess who leads the music, nor, for the matter of
that, who gives lessons in Theology! A book
full of lovely summer secrets, just right for the
little people to read during the winter evenings.</p>

<p>Pictures? I should think so! Lovely ones;
almost every page in the book is illustrated.
Some of your little brothers ought to send for
copies for Christmas presents for the sisters, or
cousins, who always expect books from you.</p>

<p>Would it do, I wonder, to tell you a secret?</p>

<p>I mean you boys and girls who have read, and
who love, “Grandpa’s Darlings?”</p>

<p>The truth is, this Grace Livingston is the
very little “Gracie,” Grandpa’s own darling,
who has grown up to be a young woman, and
the first day she had a chance, she wrote this
book, all about a queer, sweet, new Chautauqua;
just to pay her “Auntie Belle,” for telling all
sorts of funny things about her when she was
Grandpa’s Darling.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="smcap">Scripture Birthday Book.</span> Price, $1.00.
I thought I was tired of Autograph Albums, but
this pretty little book bound in green and gold,
containing a carefully-selected Bible-verse, and
a verse of a hymn, for each day in the year,
with a blank space for friends to write their
names, gives me a great deal of pleasure. I
think I should like to write in such a book as
this. I’m sure I should like to give each of my
young friends a Christmas present of a copy;
and I would ask them to please learn the verse
for each day. The one for the first day of the
New Year is: “Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving,
for consider how great things he hath
done for you.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 272px;">
<img src="images/illus102.jpg" width="272" height="385" alt="Snow landsdcape with cabins" />
<div class="caption">He giveth snow like wool: He scattereth the hoar-frost
like ashes.—<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> cxlvii. 16.<br />

FROM THE “SCRIPTURE BIRTHDAY BOOK.”</div>
</div>

<p>And the accompanying verse is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Man’s life’s a book of history;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The leaves thereof, are days;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The letters, mercies closely joined;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The title is, Thy praise.”</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Ah! there are pictures in it, too; one for each
month. The first one shows us such a lovely
snowy world, that I will have it copied for you
to see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True Stories of American Wars.</span> From
Records and Famous Traditions. Ill. Boston: D.
Lothrop Company. Price, $1.25. The twelve capital
stories that make up this volume will furnish
a rich feast for patriotic and venture-loving boys
and girls. The statement upon the title-page that
they were drawn from old records and family
traditions is literally true; each story has its
appropriate basis of fact, and some of them are
very slightly embellished indeed. In every family
of the older States there are legends of the old
Indian wars which have never been written; and
records of suffering and privation, of deeds of
daring and heroism, which to-day seem almost
incredible. And fresher and more vivid than
these are the tales of the Revolution, the battles,
skirmishes and marches in which our ancestors
participated, comparatively few of which have
been told outside the family circle or the localities
where they occurred. There is not a town along
the shores of Connecticut and Massachusetts but
has its traditions, and something more than traditions,
of deeds that took place during the later
war of 1812, as stirring, perhaps, as any of those
of older times. From this great mass of material
the authors represented in the volume have
drawn the narratives they have here set down.
Among them is the story of the capture of the
British General Prescott, in command at Newport,
by a picked party of Americans under Colonel
Barton, one of the most daring exploits of
the Revolution. Another is the narrative of the
raid of the Indians upon Royalton, Vt., in 1780,
when the village was burned and several of the
inhabitants murdered. Other sketches are entitled,
“A Revolutionary Turncoat,” “The First Blow
for American Liberty,” “Joel Jackson’s Smack,”
etc. Most of the stories are illustrated.</p>

years a problem and a paradox. With manners
and customs analagous to those of almost every
nation of civilized antiquity his origin remains as
great a mystery as ever. The owner and lord of a
continent, his possessions have shrunk to nothing
and his native freedom has faded away into a state
of sullen vassalage. Theorized over and speculated
about by scholars and scientists, made the
text of many a disquisition by philosophers and
economists, used now as a hero and now as a fiend
by romancer and poet, and played with as a shuttlecock
by philanthropist and politician, his story has
never yet been fully told, nor the record of his
power, his progress and his decline been given in
anything like historic detail.</p>

<p>The material devoted to the several phases of
the Indian’s history is very great, but no consecutive
record exists in all this material, and one who
wishes to follow the course of the red-man’s rise
and decline has heretofore been unable to intelligently
select from the accumulated record enough
connected material to present a satisfactory survey
of the case. Of late years the public conscience
has been aroused to something like interest in the
Indian; his wrongs are admitted and, almost too
late, measures for his help and his reclamation find
listeners and supporters. The American sense of
justice has developed into something like a determination
to see justice done to an unfortunate race,
and official mismanagement of Indian affairs as
well as border tyrannies over a fallen foe arouse
more indignation and protest than have yet been
known since the days of discovery and conquest.
It is with the desire to place before the American
public a rounded record of this conquered race at
precisely the time when inquiry and interest in
them are both awakened that Mr. Brooks has prepared
and published his “Story of the American
Indian.” The volume has no pet theory to advocate,
it advances no solution of the Indian problem. It
seeks only to place before the readers of the land
the story of an injured race in strong but simple
language and in brief but direct detail.</p>

<p>The many and conflicting theories as to the Indian’s
origin have been sifted and debated, and
what seems the most practical and the simplest explanation
is given. The condition and culture of
the red-man through a thousand years of supremacy
before the era of discovery are thoughtfully
stated. The story of colonial mistreatment
and of national indifference are told and the real
story of the Indian is here set down in the plainest
but most forcible manner. The story is told in a
style that will interest both young and old alike,
and the earnestness of its telling can hardly fail
to arouse interest and awaken sympathy. As the
record of a race that has yielded to the dominant
energy of its conquerors, the book merits more
than passing attention and must stand as a glimpse
at a life that has long since lost its manhood and
its identity, and the story of a race that has fallen
victim to the vices rather than the prowess of a
higher civilization.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs:—I have been entirely bald for several years hereditaryly
I suppose, as my ansesters was bald so far back as I can remember or
have any knowledge. I tried all the hair vigors that I could handly get
holt of for several years but all of no use I became discouraged and
quit concluded it was hereditary and that my hare would never be restored
a gan. So in April 1885 I was pursuaded by Dr. C. C. Conaway
to try Lyon’s Kathairon and to my great surprise a fine suit of
hair was soon perceptable I continued the use of your Kathairon. I
know have a fine suit of hare for wich I am very thankful.</p>

<div class="adtitle3">BUBBLE PARTIES.</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE of the most amusing, as well as easily arranged entertainments
for the Holidays, is a “Bubble Party.” Twenty or
more ladies and gentlemen, enough clay pipes so each will have
one, three or four bowls of soap-suds, and, say, half a dozen trifles,
for prizes, are all that is required, the prizes to be awarded to
those who blow the largest bubbles, one of the party to act as
referee.</p>

<p>The suds should be of <span class="smcap">Ivory Soap</span>, as it gives a clean, white,
and abundant lather, with an entire freedom from oil or grease;
and as the materials of which it is made are so clean and pure,
it is not at all offensive to the smell or taste, like ordinary soap.</p>

<p class="center">A WORD OF WARNING.</p>

<p><b>There are many white soaps, each represented to be “just as good as the ‘Ivory’;”
they ARE NOT, but like all counterfeits, lack the peculiar and remarkable qualities of
the genuine. Ask for “Ivory” Soap and insist upon getting it</b>.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
